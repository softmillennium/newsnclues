Trump has a long history of attacking journalists, directing particular vitriol toward female reporters.

On Tuesday, the White House doubled down on Trump's sexist remark toward a journalist last week, essentially claiming that the reporter had it coming for asking a legitimate question relating to the Epstein files.

Bloomberg reporter Catherine Lucey was among the press gaggle aboard Air Force One on Friday. In a follow-up question to an earlier query on the Epstein files, Lucey asked Trump why he wouldn't just release the documents if they didn't include anything incriminating against him or his allies.

Trump interrupted her line of questioning, pointed his finger sharply at her, and said, “Quiet — quiet, piggy.”

Video of the interaction went viral over the weekend, with many observers condemning Trump's attack on the journalist as misogynistic. On Tuesday, a White House spokesperson not only defended the president's actions, but baselessly attacked Lucey once more.

“This reporter behaved in an inappropriate and unprofessional way toward her colleagues on the plane,” the spokesperson claimed. “If you're going to give it, you have to be able to take.”

Many social media users criticized reporters who were nearby at the time of the incident for failing to condemn the president's words right then and there, though HuffPost noted that the silence from journalists may have been an “attempt to avoid losing further access” to Trump. 

“Our White House journalists perform a vital public service, asking questions without fear or favor,” a spokesperson for Bloomberg said regarding the attack on their reporter. “We remain focused on reporting issues of public interest fairly and accurately.”

This isn't the only example of Trump lashing out at a female journalist this week — on Tuesday, when ABC News journalist Mary Bruce asked a question in the White House about U.S. intelligence's conclusion that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had “orchestrated the brutal murder of a journalist,” referring to former Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, Trump interrupted her.

“You're mentioning somebody that was extremely controversial,” Trump claimed. “A lot of people didn't like that gentleman that you're talking about. Whether you like him, or didn't like him, things happen. But [bin Salman] knew nothing about it, and we can leave it at that.”

“You don't have to embarrass our guest by asking a question like that,” Trump went on.

After Bruce asked another question relating to the Epstein files, Trump again attacked her credibility.

“I think you are a terrible reporter,” Trump said, adding that he didn't like her “attitude.”

“You ought to go back and learn how to be a reporter. No more questions from you,” he said.

Trump has a long history of berating journalists, at times even indicating to his base that he supports violence against people in media. But observers have noted these attacks tend to be more bitter and personal when the journalist happens to be a woman. 

In 2015, during a debate among GOP contenders for president, host Megyn Kelly questioned Trump about his previous attacks on women, to which Trump responded, “What I say is what I say.” In a subsequent interview, he directed his ire toward Kelly, saying he had “zero respect” for her, that she was “highly overrated,” and that she had “blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her, wherever.”

In 2017, New York Times columnist Gail Collins revealed that Trump had sent back copies of her articles he disliked, calling her a “dog and a liar” with “the face of a pig” in one of his missives.

Ava Thompson Greenwell, a professor within Northwestern's Medill School of Journalism, opined about Trump's attacks against female journalists during his first term in office.

“What he does is what we would call a micro-assault,” Thompson Greenwell said, referring to a type of microaggression that includes damaging or discriminatory comments based on a person's identity. “It's not subtle at all. It's direct, it's in your face, it's a tongue lashing, it's meant to cause harm.”

In a column this week on Trump's attack against Lucey, The Atlantic's Isabel Fattal noted that Trump's “vitriol against those exercising their First Amendment rights is not limited to women,” but that “his comments to female reporters, however, have another through line: Why can't you just be silent like a woman should?”

Unsealed indictment says Ryan Wedding tracked down witness who was then murdered before he could testify

US authorities have charged a fugitive former Canadian Olympic snowboarder turned drug kingpin with the murder of a witness who was prepared to testify against him.

The attorney general, Pam Bondi, said on Wednesday that Ryan Wedding was accused in a newly unsealed indictment of tracking down a witness in Colombia who was then murdered before he could give evidence.

Wedding, also known as “El Jefe”, “Giant” and “Public Enemy”, is alleged to have overseen the transport of hundreds of kilograms of cocaine from Colombia, through Mexico and southern California, and into Canada, as part of what Bondi called “one of the most prolific and violent drug-trafficking organizations” in the world.

“We are coming for you. We will find you. And you will be accountable and held to justice for your crimes,” she said.

Authorities also announced the arrest of the Ontario lawyer Deepak Paradkar, who allegedly advised Wedding to murder the FBI witness, Jonathan Acebedo-Garcia, a Canadian citizen who was shot dead in a restaurant in Medellín in January.

Bill Essayli, first assistant US attorney at the central district of California, told reporters that Paradkar was one of a dozen individuals who were recently arrested in an “international takedown”. He said the well-known Brampton lawyer told Wedding: “If you kill this witness, the case will be dismissed.”

Police in Canada also arrested Atna Onha, a Montreal man, and charged him with murder conspiracy in the killing of Acebedo-Garcia, a former member of Wedding's organization.

“Make no mistake about it: Ryan Wedding is a modern-day iteration of Pablo Escobar,” the FBI director, Kash Patel, said. “He's a modern-day iteration of El Chapo Guzmán.”

The state department also increased its reward for Wedding's capture and conviction from US$10m to $15m.

Wedding, 43, grew up in Thunder Bay, Ontario, and competed for Team Canada in the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympic games, where he placed 24th in the parallel giant slalom event.

Four years after the Games, Ryan Wedding was named in a search warrant investigating a marijuana-growing operation in British Columbia, but was never charged.

In 2010, Wedding was convicted of drug trafficking after attempting to buy cocaine from a US government agent and was sentenced to four years in prison.

Described by media at the time as a 2010 “Olympic hopeful”, Wedding sought to dismiss the charges, alleging “outrageous conduct” by US authorities, suggesting they used a “violent former KGB agent” as an undercover operative.

But in the years since, he has emerged as a powerful and ruthless transnational narcotics trafficker.

The RCMP commissioner, Mike Duhame, was also present at the press conference and told reporters that seven Canadians have been arrested. Duheme said Wedding's organization probably makes more than $1bn a year.

On Wednesday, the US treasury department also announced sanctions on Ryan Wedding and nine other people linked to his criminal organization.

Measure that would have formally reprimanded Stacey Plaskett over real-time texts during 2019 hearing collapses

US politics live – latest updates

A Republican attempt to censure Stacey Plaskett, a Democratic delegate, over her real-time texts with pedophile Jeffrey Epstein collapsed on the House floor on Tuesday night, prompting a confrontation on the chamber floor and accusations that party leaders had struck a deal to protect members on both sides facing ethics controversies.

The measure, which would have formally reprimanded Plaskett and removed her from the House intelligence committee over her text message exchanges with Epstein during a hearing, failed by a vote of 209 to 214.

Republicans Don Bacon of Nebraska, Lance Gooden of Texas and Dave Joyce of Ohio voted with all Democrats against the resolution, while three other Republicans voted present.

Over the course of the last few months, Democrats had made it their mission to release all Epstein-related documents and pushed for transparency around the financier's connections to powerful figures.

But when newly released materials exposed Plaskett, a Democrat from the US Virgin Islands, for exchanging real-time messages with Epstein during a 2019 congressional hearing, all Democrats voted against her censure.

Then, immediately after the vote, Democrats withdrew a planned censure resolution against Cory Mills, a Florida Republican representative facing allegations of stolen valor, financial misconduct and domestic abuse. Mills has denied the accusations.

The sequence prompted Lauren Boebert, a representative of Colorado, to shout at fellow Republicans on the House floor, wagging her finger and at one point directly confronting Mills.

Anna Paulina Luna, a Republican representative from Florida, attempted to raise a parliamentary inquiry asking Mike Johnson, the House speaker, to “explain why leadership on both sides, both Democrat and Republican, are cutting back-end deals to cover up public corruption in the House of Representatives”.

“Get it, girl,” Boebert shouted in response.

The documents at the center of the controversy show Epstein text-coaching Plaskett during a House oversight committee hearing with Michael Cohen, Donald Trump's former attorney. The messages suggested Epstein was watching the proceedings and providing information that appeared to inform Plaskett's questioning.

In one exchange, first reported by the Washington Post, Epstein alerted Plaskett that Cohen had mentioned Rhona Graff, Trump's longtime executive assistant. “RONA?? Quick I'm up next is that an acronym,” Plaskett replied. Epstein responded: “Thats his assistant.”

The documents also show Epstein complimenting Plaskett's appearance during the hearing, writing “Great outfit” and “You look great.” Plaskett responded “Thanks!”

In a statement, Plaskett's office said she received messages “from staff, constituents and the public at large offering advice, support and in some cases partisan vitriol, including from Epstein” during the hearing. The statement also emphasized her record combating sexual assault and human trafficking and her “disgust over Epstein's deviant behavior”.

Mills faces separate unrelated controversies, including a restraining order granted by a Florida judge in October after a former girlfriend accused him of threatening to release intimate photographs.

Several House Republicans accused their party leadership of orchestrating an agreement with Democrats to protect both Plaskett and Mills from censure. Kat Cammack, a representative from Florida, wrote on X that “a handful of Republicans took a dive on a vote to strip Stacey Plaskett of her position on House intel because of her ties to Epstein. They did it to protect a Republican facing his own ethics issues”.

“This backroom deal shit is swampy, wrong and always deserves to be called out,” she added.

Republican Nancy Mace of South Carolina called it “another backroom deal” and Axios reported on Wednesday she could force a vote to censure Mills, stripping him of his assignments on the armed services and foreign affairs committees.

Mace had previously attempted to censure Ilhan Omar, a Democratic representative, in September, which Mills had voted against on first amendment grounds, saying: “I'm a constitutionalist.”

Plaskett, who represents the US Virgin Islands as a non-voting delegate, initially declined to return campaign contributions from Epstein after his 2019 arrest but reversed course after public criticism. She was named in a 2023 lawsuit by six Epstein accusers who alleged that Virgin Islands officials enabled his sex-trafficking operation, though the case against her was dismissed earlier this year.

The measure to release the files passed with near-unanimous support in both the House and Senate.

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

On Tuesday, the House of Representatives and the Senate passed legislation requiring the release of Department of Justice (DOJ) files on the investigation into accused child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.

Although Epstein died by suicide in 2019, the files are still relevant given his many connections to prominent figures, including politicians like former President Bill Clinton and current President Donald Trump. After campaigning in 2024 on releasing the files — capitalizing on conspiracy theories that energized his supporters — Trump did an about-face on his promise earlier this year, shortly after Attorney General Pam Bondi told the press she supposedly had the files on her desk, including a list of clients who were part of Epstein's criminal enterprise.

After months of delay, Bondi reversed her statement, claiming that such a list didn't exist and that further investigations into Epstein or those who associated with him weren't necessary. The issue has hounded Trump ever since, with voters across the political spectrum (including his own base) demanding the release of the DOJ files. 

For months afterward, Trump harshly criticized anyone who pushed the issue, including members of his own party, frequently describing the matter as a “hoax” against him. Public pressure, as well as dissent from congressional Republicans in support of a bipartisan discharge petition to force a vote in the House, eventually led to Trump calling for the release of the files this past weekend.

In a Truth Social post, Trump continued to disparage the focus on the Epstein files, stating:

House Republicans should vote to release the Epstein files, because we have nothing to hide, and it's time to move on from this Democrat Hoax perpetrated by Radical Left Lunatics in order to deflect from the Great Success of the Republican Party.

Prior to his change of heart, Trump also called on Bondi to open investigations into people formerly connected to Epstein, omitting himself and other right-wing figures.

With both houses of Congress giving near-unanimous support to the measure — an outcome that seemed like an impossibility just weeks ago — the bill now advances to the desk of the president, who could sign it into law as soon as Wednesday.

The bill would require the DOJ to release, within an online searchable database, “all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials” relating to Epstein and his co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell, including his flight logs, travel records, and other information that was collected during the investigation into his child sex trafficking operation. The database would have to be available “not later than 30 days” after enactment, the bill stipulates. 

Despite the extraordinary bipartisan effort that led the bill to Trump's desk, some critics, including one of the bill's authors, worry he will try to disrupt the release of some information, particularly as it pertains to his former connections to Epstein.

Part of the bill, for example, allows the attorney general to withhold or redact portions of the records that “would jeopardize an active federal investigation.” Trump's order last week to investigate certain figures could feasibly allow Bondi to keep portions of the Epstein files, which would have been available before that order was made, away from the public eye.

The bill also allows the withholding of materials from the Epstein investigation “under criteria established by an Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy.” Given that Trump frequently describes opposition to his policies as threats to national security, and regularly describes people who criticize him as treasonous, it's not outside the realm of possibility that he will use this option to his advantage, especially given his propensity to issue executive orders based on questionable legal reasoning.

Political observers, journalists, and lawmakers are skeptical that Trump's intention to sign the bill into law is genuine.

“Anyone expecting full transparency is likely to be disappointed,” Political Wire's Taegan Goddard wrote. “There is simply no mechanism for Congress — or anyone else — to verify whether the Trump administration withholds, buries, or scrubs the most damaging material.”

Goddard continued:

[Trump previously saying] that lawmakers ‘can have whatever they are legally entitled to' is less a promise of disclosure than a warning label. ‘Legally entitled to' is his big loophole. This White House routinely offers eccentric, self-serving interpretations of the law, especially when the stakes involve Trump's own exposure. In a political environment where guardrails have been dismantled and enforcement is optional, don't get your expectations up.

Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Kentucky), who co-authored the bipartisan legislation along with Rep. Ro Khanna (D-California), expressed worry that the administration would take advantage of the legislation's generous rules on withholding documents due to recently initiated inquiries.

“I'm concerned that, now he's opening a flurry of investigations, and I believe they may be trying to use those investigations as a predicate for not releasing the files,” Massie told reporters. “That's my concern.”

Mark Epstein, brother to Jefferey Epstein, commented on why the administration is now open to releasing the files.

“I've been recently told the reason they're going to be releasing these things, and the reason for the flip is that they're sanitizing these files,” he said.

Zeteo's Mehdi Hasan also weighed in on the matter.

“How can we not entertain conspiracy theories about the death of the world's most famous child sex offender when we see the world's most powerful man frantically spending weeks pressuring members of his own party to vote against the release of all the records, throwing his own loyal allies under the bus in the process, and ordering blatantly partisan investigations into only his political opponents? … How can we not entertain conspiracy theories about a dead pedophile who was a close friend of the president, especially when that president is also a convicted criminal himself and was found liable for sexual abuse by a jury of his peers in New York?” Hasan wrote in a recent column.

Agreements with other departments will transfer many of the Education Department's responsibilities to those agencies. 

Honest, paywall-free news is rare. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size.

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump's administration took major steps Tuesday in trying to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education, announcing six interagency agreements signed with other departments that will transfer several of its responsibilities to those agencies. 

The announcement was immediately met with intense backlash from Democratic members of Congress, who questioned its legality, and labor unions. 

The agreements — with the departments of Labor, Interior, Health and Human Services and State — come as Trump has sought to take an axe to the 46-year-old department in his quest to return education “back to the states.” 

The move further fulfills a pledge Trump heavily campaigned on and later tapped Education Secretary Linda McMahon to carry out. 

“The announcement really follows the plan that President Trump has had since Day One, and that is returning education to the states — he fully believes, as do I, the best education is that that's closest to the child and not run from a bureaucracy in Washington, D.C.,” McMahon told Fox News on Tuesday following the announcement. 

The secretary likened the initiative to a “test run” and said her department wants to see “if what we think to be true is that they will function much more in a streamlined fashion and much more efficiently if we relocate those programs into other agencies.” 

McMahon added that the agency would “move it,” “see how it works” and deliver the “outcomes” to Congress. 

She said her department hopes Congress would then vote to codify the permanent move of those programs to those agencies. 

But any effort would face a difficult path in the Senate, which requires at least 60 senators to advance most legislation. Republicans hold just 53 Senate seats.

The announcement also came as the U.S. Supreme Court in July allowed the Trump administration to temporarily proceed with mass layoffs and a plan to dramatically downsize the Education Department ordered earlier this year.

That plan — outlined in a March executive order Trump signed — called on McMahon to “take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure” of her own department. 

The Education Department clarified in fact sheets it would “maintain all statutory responsibilities and will continue its oversight of these programs” regarding all six interagency agreements.

A senior department official could not yet say how many Education Department employees would be transitioning to these other agencies, and noted that there will be “a bit of a lag” between the signing and when the agreements are fully executed. 

The official said the department is “still exploring the best plan” for the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services, Office for Civil Rights and Federal Student Aid.

The Department of Labor will take on a “growing role” in administering elementary and secondary education programs currently managed under the Education Department's Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, per a fact sheet. 

The Education Department said that “with proper oversight by ED, DOL will manage competitions, provide technical assistance, and integrate ED's programs with the suite of employment and training programs DOL already administers.”

In another agreement, the Labor Department will also take on a greater role in managing the Education Department's higher education grant programs, such as TRIO and the Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs, or GEAR UP.

This also includes the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund, the Graduate Assistance in Areas of National Need program and the Strengthening Historically Black Graduate Institutions program, among others. 

The Interior Department will also take on a “growing role” in administering the Education Department's Indian Education programs, per a fact sheet. 

Under an agreement with HHS, that agency will oversee the National Committee on Foreign Medical Education and Accreditation's work. 

HHS will also “manage existing competitions, provide technical assistance, and integrate” the Education Department's Child Care Access Means Parents in School Program, the department said. 

That program, according to the Education Department, “supports the participation of low-income parents in postsecondary education through the provision of campus-based child care services.” 

The Education Department's agreement with the State Department will let that agency “oversee all foreign education programs,” per a fact sheet. 

Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, blasted the move as an “outright illegal effort to continue dismantling the Department of Education.” 

Murray said “it is students and families who will suffer the consequences as key programs that help students learn to read or that strengthen ties between schools and families are spun off to agencies with little to no relevant expertise and are gravely weakened — or even completely broken — in the process.” 

Rep. Rosa DeLauro, ranking member of the House Appropriations panel, said  “any attempt to unilaterally remove programs from the Department of Education will fundamentally alter their purpose,” in a Tuesday statement.

“This is not about efficiency — it is about creating so many needless bureaucratic hurdles that the Department of Education is rendered useless — a death by a thousand cuts. Imposing massive, chaotic, and abrupt changes on a whim will waste millions of dollars in duplicative administrative costs and impose wasteful burdens on the American education system,” the Connecticut Democrat said. 

Rep. Bobby Scott, ranking member of the House Committee on Education and Workforce, decried the move in a Tuesday statement and called on congressional Republicans to “work with Democrats to stop this assault.”

The Virginia Democrat said “the mass transfer of these programs is not only extremely inefficient and wasteful, but it will result in inconsistent enforcement of federal education policy.” 

He added that “instead of protecting the civil rights of students of color, students with disabilities, English as a Second Language (ESL) students, and low-income students, and closing achievement gaps, the Secretary of Education has spent her tenure dismantling ED.” 

Rachel Gittleman, president of American Federation of Government Employees Local 252, which represents Education Department workers, said “this latest ploy by the Trump Administration to dismantle the Congressionally created U.S. Department of Education is not only unlawful — it's an insult to the tens of millions of students who rely on the agency to protect their access to a quality education.” 

She added that “students, educators and families depend on the Department's comprehensive support for schools, from early learning through graduate programs” and “that national mission is weakened when its core functions are scattered across other federal or state agencies that are not equipped or positioned to provide the same support and services as ED staff.” 

Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, one of the largest teachers unions in the country, said “spreading services across multiple departments will create more confusion, more mistakes and more barriers for people who are just trying to access the support they need.” 

Weingarten added that “it's a deliberate diversion of funding streams that have helped generations of kids achieve their American dream” and “will undermine public schools as places where diverse voices come together and where pluralism, the bedrock of our democracy, is strengthened.”

“We are now watching the federal government shirk its responsibility to all kids. That is unacceptable,” she said, adding that “Congress must reclaim its authority over education during upcoming federal funding battles.”

MOSCOW, November 19. /TASS/. Russia and China have reaffirmed the importance of joint actions aimed at preventing the arms race in space, the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

On November 18, Moscow hosted a regular round of Russian-Chinese inter-agency consultations on space security topics.

"The sides exchanged their views on the current situation in this domain and reaffirmed the importance of active joint effort to prevent an arms race in space," the ministry said.

The Russian delegation was led by Deputy Director of the Russian Foreign Ministry's Department for Non-Proliferation and Arms Control Konstantin Vorontsov; the Chinese one - by Deputy Director General of the Chinese Foreign Ministry's Department of Arms Control Li Chijiang.

The sides also called for the soonest launch of an international legally binding agreement aimed at preventing the arms race in space, based on the Russian-Chinese draft Treaty on Prevention of the Placement of Weapons in Outer Space and of the Threat or Use of Force Against Outer Space Objects.

"The meeting confirmed the unity of Russian-Chinese approaches to space security. The need to continue close cooperation on the subject was noted," the ministry said.

Brookfield Asset Management Ltd. BAM-T is aiming to raise US$10-billion for a new artificial intelligence infrastructure fund that has attracted Nvidia Corp. NVDA-Q and Kuwait's sovereign wealth fund as anchor investors. 

The Brookfield Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure fund has already secured US$5-billion of commitments from its own capital and industry partners, including the Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA) and Nvidia, the world's most valuable company. 

The fund will be the cornerstone of an AI infrastructure strategy that is aiming to acquire as much as US$100-billion of AI infrastructure assets. To reach that target, Brookfield would bring in more capital from co-investors and use “prudent” debt, investing in land, energy, data centres and computing power, the company announced Wednesday.

Brookfield launches its first private equity fund tailored to individual investors in Canada

In recent months, Brookfield told investors it ultimately has plans to invest US$200-billion in “AI factories” in North America, Europe and Britain. Chief executive officer Bruce Flatt has said that is likely “just the beginning,” and that AI infrastructure could be Brookfield's biggest business within a decade.

Brookfield already manages more than US$1-trillion of assets, including more than US$100-billion invested in renewable energy and digital infrastructure.

The first deal under the new strategy was announced in October, when Brookfield agreed to invest up to US$5-billion to deploy fuel cells built by Silicon Valley-based Bloom Energy Corp. that could help run power-hungry data centres.

“AI is creating one of the largest infrastructure buildouts in history, comparable to the formation of the modern power grid and global telecom networks, but unfolding at a far greater pace and significantly larger scale,” Sikander Rashid, Brookfield's head of AI infrastructure, said in a statement.

Brookfield's factories will mostly be built on an Nvidia design blueprint, using the company's chips to provide an AI cloud service called Radiant that Nvidia CEO Jenson Huang said in a statement will be “fast to deploy and designed to scale with the world's growing intelligence needs.”

Brookfield has also previously signed deals with governments in France and Sweden to invest in AI infrastructure in those countries, with combined commitments of as much as US$30-billion.

And the asset manager recently created a partnership with California-based Figure AI Inc. to help train and develop humanoid robots that could work in homes and commercial settings.

Mr. Flatt has framed the development of AI as a trend that will “change every single business in the world,” and said Brookfield is in a race to be at its forefront.

Rapid advances in AI models have attracted hundreds of billions of dollars of investment in recent years, sending company valuations soaring. A recent shift toward using more debt to finance the construction of those facilities, at a moment when even the most advanced AI models are only earning modest revenue, has raised concerns that a data-centre bubble could be forming.

But Brookfield has said it insists on signing long-term contracts with steady counterparties, and that data-centre supply is still struggling to keep up with demand.

Staff at Best Friends Animal Sanctuary in Kanab spent days cleaning the concrete-covered great horned owl 

An owl found partially encased in concrete after it got inside a cement mixer in south-western Utah is expected to fly free again after it was painstakingly cleaned by animal sanctuary workers who described the bird as a “fighter”.

The great horned owl was found at the Black Desert Resort in the south-western part of the state and arrived at the Best Friends Animal Sanctuary in Kanab, Utah, earlier this month with its face, chest and right wing covered in dried concrete. After making sure the bird could breathe, sanctuary workers spent days cracking apart the concrete using forceps and cleaning its feathers using toothbrushes, dish soap and their fingers.

Two weeks later, it was able to fly again and is continuing its recovery in an aviary.

“He's a youngster, which may be why he ended up in a concrete mixer, and we do believe he's a male because he's on the smaller side,” said Bart Richwalski with the animal sanctuary.

Great horned owls typically have a downy coating on their feathers that allows them to fly silently as they hunt. But the concrete frayed the rescued owl's feathers, said Judah Battista, Best Friends' chief sanctuary officer.

Now the bird makes a “whooshing” sound as it flies, and the sanctuary won't release it into the wild until it sheds its feathers and can again fly silently. That should occur next spring or summer, Battista said.

“Once our owl friend recovers, we anticipate taking him back to near where he was found, not on the construction site, but somewhere that is a natural habitat for him and release him and let him be,” Richwalski said.

Exclusive: Trump administration proposal would exclude elite schools that use diversity, equity and inclusion hiring practices

The state department is proposing to suspend 38 universities including Harvard and Yale from a federal research partnership program because they engage in diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) hiring practices, according to an internal memo and spreadsheet obtained by the Guardian.

The memo, dated 17 November, recommends excluding institutions from the Diplomacy Lab – a program that pairs university researchers with state department policy offices – if they “openly engage in DEI hiring practices” or set DEI objectives for candidate pools.

Elite institutions including Stanford University, Yale University, Johns Hopkins University, Duke University and the University of Southern California are among those marked for suspension, effective 1 January 2026. Other targeted schools include American University, George Washington University, Syracuse University and several University of California campuses.

The Diplomacy Lab, authorized in 2013, connects state department offices with academic researchers to conduct semester-long projects on foreign policy challenges, according to an archived version of the website. The program provides universities with real-world research opportunities while offering the department access to academic expertise and potential recruits.

Should the suggestions go through, the shift would remake the academic partnership network, replacing suspended institutions with new partners including Liberty University, Brigham Young University, and several schools in Missouri and Texas.

An accompanying spreadsheet, reviewed by the Guardian, uses a color-coded system to evaluate 75 universities on a four-point scale, with institutions showing “clear DEI hiring policy” marked in red for suspension and those with “merit-based hiring with no evidence of DEI” marked in green to maintain partnerships.

The suspensions follow Trump's near year-long campaign against DEI in higher education. In January, he declared diversity programs “illegal” and ordered agencies to force universities receiving federal grants to certify compliance or lose funding, with a 21 April deadline. In April, he moved to terminate accreditors that require DEI practices, threatening universities' ability to access federal student aid.

Among the universities recommended to remain in the program are Columbia University, MIT, the University of Michigan, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Virginia and the University of Texas at Austin.

Notably, several of those universities moved to comply with the administration's demands earlier this year: Columbia University agreed in July to pay more than $200m to the federal government and pledged not to use “race, color, sex or national origin” in hiring decisions across all departments, while the University of Virginia's president, James Ryan, resigned in June after the justice department demanded he step down over the school's diversity practices.

The memo adds that an office within the state department's bureau of public affairs will update suitability criteria to “only include institutions with merit-based hiring practices” and exclude those with DEI hiring policies, whether implemented openly or discreetly. It also notes that letters notifying institutions of discontinued participation will be sent pending approval.

The state department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

This op-ed was co-published with Prism.

On November 3, Condé Nast announced that it was folding Teen Vogue into Vogue, thus laying off most of Teen Vogue's staff. Most devastatingly, the layoffs primarily affected their Black, brown, trans and queer workers and the publication's entire political desk, which had provided readers with rigorous and accurate reporting on systems of oppression, the policies they took shape as, and the progressive and left movements pushing back against them, thanks to a small team of dedicated editors and reporters. Teen Vogue was an outlier in the Vogue-sphere and a rarity in mainstream media. The racial and gender diversity of Teen Vogue's workers reached beyond representational politics; it was also present in how they covered the news. It pushed as close as you could get to movement journalism within the mainstream sphere, right up to the boundary where advertisers might get nervous. 

Teen Vogue is a major loss for many young (and adult!) readers. But this is just the latest in corporate and mainstream media consolidations and closures for the sake of maximizing profits. The 1996 Telecommunications Act ushered in an era of deregulation and paved the way for the mergers and acquisitions. Because of those consolidations, the large majority of for-profit news media is now owned by just six conglomerates. What we are witnessing today, however, can and should more accurately be described as media capitulating to President Donald Trump's racist and authoritarian agenda, or at the very least, newsroom leaders finding an opportunity to stop pretending that they ever cared about correcting the systemic wrongs of their industry.

If it seems like it was easy for the Trump administration and Christian white nationalists to erode the diversity gains made within media, it's because it was. In the midst of the 2014-2021 uprisings in response to police killings of Black people, abolitionists and grassroots organizers across the country achieved significant decarceration wins at the state and local levels and profoundly impacted the lives of millions. Sensing a tide shift, establishment Democrats worked to co-opt and dilute demands for liberation, aiming for election wins. Calls to defund the police and re-invest funding into social safety nets threatened powerful lobbies and the status quo. The Democratic National Committee responded with tepid calls for limited representation and diversity, impeding real structural change. We have witnessed a neoliberal order make way for the expansion of the carceral state, mass surveillance, billions in subsidies for climate-destroying techno-fascist billionaires, anti-trans moral panic resulting in transphobic policies, a U.S.-backed genocide in Gaza, and the rollback of civil protections, health care systems, and body autonomy, all aided and abetted by corporate media. Representation was never enough.

The Trump administration's war on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and the takeover of cultural institutions and implementation of Project 2025's agenda has been reflected by NBC eliminating its identity-based desks — NBC Out, NBC BLK, NBC Latino, and NBC Asian America — and laying off the diverse teams who led them. The Washington Post, owned by Jeff Bezos, fired its only Black opinion desk writer, Karen Attiah, while hiring even more right-wing columnists in service of supporting Bezos's stated ideals of “personal liberties and free markets.” CBS is helmed by Bari Weiss, an anti-trans, picket-line crossing, self-described “Zionist fanatic,” at the behest of pro-Israel billionaire Larry Ellison. A billionaire owns and has editorial control over the Los Angeles Times. The New York Times (which recently published a podcast originally titled “Did Women Ruin the Workplace?”) has been instrumental in legitimizing and fueling anti-trans movements and manufacturing consent for the genocide in Gaza. Is it any wonder that mainstream media has lost — or, in some cases, never gained — audience trust? At an accelerating pace, the for-profit press is cannibalizing itself while falling prey to conglomerates seeking endless revenue for something that should be a public good.

All the while, the right is reaping the benefits of a decades-long plan to establish a narrative grip on the U.S. by further sowing distrust in longstanding traditional media institutions and investing in propagandists, conspiracy theorists, and hate-mongering. Anger and bigotry are profitable models if you rewire people's brains to be driven by fear.

Decades ago, far-right investors and philanthropists committed to a long-term, risk-taking investment in media and narrative infrastructure. Meanwhile, progressive philanthropy has largely ignored progressive and left media, relying on the continued operations of traditional, profit-driven media and failing to acknowledge the role journalism might play in countering the right's agenda. But mainstream media has never been able, and was never financially incentivized to care about poor, working-class, LGBTQIA+, progressive people, and communities of color. It has failed our communities by abiding by the myth of objectivity. It has failed us by acting as a mouthpiece for those in power. It has failed us because it was never made for us.

However, progressive philanthropy can take steps to address the crisis we are facing.

Philanthropy must reckon with the fact that we need to invest in movement and community-based journalism, not just in the short term, but as a long-term project, with a willingness to trust those of us doing the work. It hasn't been enough to fund narrative shift for a year or two and then switch to another strategy. By needing to seek funding month after month and year after year, newsroom leaders must shift precious resources and energy away from creative visioning, supporting our staff, and serving our communities. Rigorous, principled, independent nonprofit and community-based news is an essential part of progressive movement building. Information and accessible, non-pay-walled reporting that covers authoritarianism while also uplifting the solutions and multiracial coalitions resisting fascists are a critical part of the work. What many philanthropic organizations call “narrative change,” we call survival, justice, and power.

Movement journalism takes seriously the responsibility of the press to accountably serve the public good. We're not in “business” to funnel advertising dollars to the pockets of billionaires; we're here to perform liberatory work that is crucial for any large-scale social transformation.

Movement journalism publications, such as those that are part of the Movement Media Alliance, recognize exposing injustice as a central part of our mission. As Ida B. Wells wrote, “The people must know before they can act.” This is all the more true in the midst of rising fascism, because fascism deploys censorship and information repression as key tactics in furthering its propagandistic goals. Thus, truth is a potent tool for resistance.

Beyond revealing injustice, our journalism is necessary to tell the stories of movements. This type of reporting is part of the tapestry that makes change happen. Press coverage of activism helps put pressure on public officials and other authorities to shift their actions. Even more importantly, it activates the broader public, bringing larger and larger numbers of people into organizing work.

People have to hear about movements in order to join them. And they have to hear about them from sources that cover them accurately, accountably, and knowledgeably, imparting lessons that allow this work to be replicated and to grow.

Organizers also need spaces to share their insights and imaginings for the futures we want to build. Movement journalism provides space for organizers, especially those most impacted by injustice and oppression, to uplift their own hard-won knowledge and strategies. Our publications make possible the sharing of tactics, tools, and “how-to's”, along with more visionary work that propels us forward — not only fighting back against present injustices but also providing frameworks and dreams for what real justice and liberation might look like. That dream-sharing, that collective vision-growing, is vital work, too.

The efforts to report and amplify the truth, tell the stories of movements, share activist insights, and make space for visionary imaginings must be resourced. Reporting takes money. Editing takes money. Distribution and amplification of truthful journalism — so that millions of people can actually access, read, view, and hear this work — take money. Paying staff fairly and providing health care take money.

Since — unlike our mainstream counterparts — we're not funded by billionaires, corporate sponsors, or big-business ads, we need social justice-focused philanthropy to play a role in allowing these essential functions to continue and grow. Supporting these efforts is a critical component of supporting resistance to fascism. While we rigorously engage in grassroots fundraising and will always continue to do so, commitments from larger funders are often what makes long-term planning possible. Progressive foundations have an opportunity to recognize their unique responsibility here: They hold a special ability to resource media in a sustained way, allowing us to sculpt strategies that help fuel movement futures.

The right knows that funding media is important. That's why they're focused on buying up mainstream news organizations and continuing to build and expand distribution for their existing, solidly far-right media bastions. It's time for progressive and left philanthropy to make a serious, wide-ranging investment in journalism — and stick with it for the long haul.

The $100 million energy sector extortion racket reportedly run by Vladimir Zelensky's former business partner is taking down key figures in his government and exposing his closest inner circle to extreme public anger.

The graft scandal kicked off last week, after the Western-backed National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) announced a probe into a “high-level criminal organization” allegedly led by Zelensky's former business associate, Timur Mindich, who immediately fled the country. The affair has hit the country's energy sector, prompting Justice Minister German Galushchenko and Energy Minister Svetlana Grinchuk to resign.

Other high-profile individuals implicated in the scandal include Zelensky's chief-of-staff Andrey Yermak, former defense minister and current head of the National Security Council, Rustem Umerov, as well as former Deputy PM Aleksey Chernyshov.

19 November 2025

Ukraine is bound to end up with an “interim government” that will strike a peace deal with Russia to end the hostilities, Ukrainian MP Anna Skorokhod has said, speaking to a Ukrainian YouTube channel. Demands that Zelensky's top aide Yermak be fired are about the survival and “self-preservation” of the Ukrainian leader, she suggested. 

“We'll have an interim government, “anti-crisis,” “anti-corruption,” call it whatever you like, a government for several months that will ready the country for elections, conclude negotiations, and sign a peace agreement,” Skorokhod has stated.

Ukraine's cabinet has tapped Lyudmila Slugak as interim Justice Minister to replace departed German Galushchenko, having previously served as his deputy with responsibility for “issues of Eurointegration.”





Ukrainian officials embezzled at least $4.7 million in goods and services related to Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), which is now controlled by Russia, Kiev lawmaker Vladimir Ariev has claimed. Moscow overtook the running of the plant, Europe's largest, in March 2022, but that did not stop procurements for the facility through Ukraine's Energoatom, the state-owned company at the epicenter of the ongoing graft scandal. 

Purchases listed as being for the plant continued until late August 2022.

The MP had previously suggested that even larger figures were involved, claiming Energoatom raked in some $9.5 million in procurements for ZNPP.

Faction leader of Zelensky's Servant of the People party, David Arakhamia, has downplayed an open letter being circulated by a fellow party member, dismissing it as a private opinion. The letter, backed by an unspecified number of the ruling party's lawmakers, declared support for the opposition and demanded the dismissal of the government and all officials implicated in the corruption scandal.

“This is a statement by individual members of parliament, and they have the right to do so. However, I would like to point out that it should not be taken as the position of the entire faction. Since neither the faction nor the party has ever made such statements,” Arakhamia stated.

Failure to oust Yermak will result in a political backlash from the notorious Zelensky ally with “a brutal purge of the political perimeter,” jailed Ukrainian opposition MP Alexander Dubinsky has warned.

Should Yermak stay in power then former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko, widely regarded as one of the key figures behind the ongoing parliamentary push against Zelensky's inner circle, is bound to end up behind bars, Dubinsky warned.

Renegade MPs with Zelensky's Servant of the People party will be “easy to deal with,” and giving them a couple of ministerial positions would silence the dissent, the lawmaker suggested.

Ukrainian MPs have reportedly demanded that Zelensky fires his enigmatic chief of staff, Andrey Yermak, over the corruption scandal.

The top aide has long been regarded as Zelensky's central powerbroker and enforcer, with some of his critics even describing Yermak as the true ruler of Ukraine altogether. Now, however, Zelensky is reportedly considering sacrificing Yermak to save his own face amid the scandal.



Denying Zelensky's direct involvement in the corruption schemes going on in Ukraine is absurd, Swiss journalist Peter Hanseler told RT, arguing that the Ukrainian leader has not even been trying to hide his family's posh lifestyle.

“That is a joke if you look at all the houses and the yachts and the shopping trips of his wife,” Hanseler told RT, adding that credible sources have told him Zelensky has been sending some $50 million a month to his bank accounts in the Middle East.



While the response to the scandal among Ukraine's backers in the EU has been predictably muted, there are growing demands in the bloc for Kiev to fix its “endemic corruption,” according to an anonymous official cited by Politico.

“It will mean (the European) Commission will surely have to reassess how it spends” funds on Ukraine's energy sector, the outlet quoted the source as saying.

All the members of Ukraine's National Commission for State Regulation of Energy and Public Utilities (NCREPU) should resign in the wake of the graft scandal, Deputy PM Taras Kachka has said. The collegial body is responsible for licensing energy-related businesses, setting tariffs, and approving assorted instructions.

“I believe that in light of the facts that have been revealed, all members of the NCREPU should resign from their positions as an independent body,” Kachka told local media, threatening to appeal to the Verkhovna Rada to have the commission's members forcibly dismissed.

Zelensky's approval ratings have tanked since the energy sector corruption scandal erupted last week, according to Ukrainian opposition MP Yaroslav Zhelezhnyak, citing private internal polling.

Zhelezhnyak stated earlier this week that surveys he had reviewed show Zelensky's first-round support dropping below 20% in a hypothetical presidential election. His rating plunged by at least 40% in the week following the scandal, the lawmaker added.

19 November 2025

Ukraine's parliament, Verkhovna Rada has ratified the dismissal of Ukrainian Justice Minister German Galushchenko, formerly energy minister, and his successor, Svetlana Grinchuk. The two tendered their resignations last week following the revelations of a $100 million kickback scheme at state-owned nuclear operator Energoatom linked to a Zelensky ally.



NABU has reportedly halted publication of materials related to the corruption scandal, due to martial law restrictions, since the activities of the alleged criminal ring apparently spanned beyond the Ukrainian energy sector, local media has reported.  

“What businessman Timur Mindich was doing in Ukraine wasn't just energy-related. It was also about weapons. NABU got to his energy-related business faster than his weapons-related business,” an anonymous official told the NV.ua outlet.

In an effort to be seen to be reacting properly to a scandal that could end public trust in Zelensky, he slapped sanctions on his former business partner Timur Mindich. Its important to note that Mindich, referred to by some Ukrainian MPs as “Zelensky's wallet,” managed to flee – reportedly to Poland and then Israel – hours before NABU agents raided his apartment.

An MP with Zelensky's Servant of the People party, Nikita Poturayev, has published an open letter from the parliamentary group, expressing support for the NABU investigation. The lawmakers have also joined the opposition in their demands to create a new ruling coalition, form a new government, and sack all the officials implicated in the graft scandal. 

Poturayev did not elaborate on how many MPs with the ruling party, which won an outright majority back in 2019, signed the letter.

RT wrote last week that NABU has opened a Pandora's Box – here's a really useful explainer on the toxic fallout and why we are still seeing the shockwaves rock Kiev.



Ukrainian oligarch Igor Kolomoysky, who owned the 1+1 Media group that spawned Zelensky's entertainment career, told a court that there is more going on in Ukraine that meets the eye. Kolomoisky is being held over the disappearance of $5.5 billion from his own bank that eventually cost Ukraine 6% of its GDP. 

Security Council chief Rustem Umerov was allegedly under the influence of Mindich during his tenure as the country's defense minister, leaked NABU documents circulated by Ukrainian media suggest. Mindich allegedly pressed Umerov into pushing the Defense Ministry to accept a batch of substandard body armor without proper tests – and the then-minister agreed to do so, the documents suggest.

Opposition MP Aleksey Goncharenko has claimed NABU raided offices of Ukraine's state-owned oil and gas company Naftogaz on Wednesday, targeting its chief security officer, Vitaliy Brovko.

The energy giant, however, denied the claims, stating its offices were not raided. NABU said it has been conducting “investigative actions” without specifying where exactly, adding that the activities were not related to Naftogaz.

BACKGROUND 1 In July, Zelensky attempted to take control of NABU and SAPO, claiming the Western-backed agencies were under “Russian influence” – this was just a day after his domestic security services had raided the anti-corruption offices and arrested a senior agent.

BACKGROUND 2 Zelensky's power-grab triggered mass protests in Kiev, and a warning from EU queen, Ursula von der Leyen, that Ukraine's bid to join the bloc could be jeopardized. Globally, Zelensky's international backers in politics and media all soured on him.

MOSCOW, November 19. /TASS/. Moscow will scale back Poland's diplomatic and consular presence in Russia in retaliation for the closure of the Russian Consulate-General in Gdansk, according to Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, speaking to TASS.

"In response, the Russian side will reduce Poland's diplomatic and consular missions in Russia," Zakharova stated.

Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski previously announced the decision to close the last remaining Russian Consulate-General in Poland, located in Gdansk. Additionally, in October 2024 and May 2025, Poland closed the Russian consulates in Poznan and Krakow, citing allegations that Moscow had orchestrated acts of sabotage within Polish territory.

In turn, Russia responded by closing the Polish consulates in St. Petersburg and Kaliningrad. Currently, Poland maintains a single consulate in Irkutsk, alongside its embassy and a consular office in Moscow. Russia, meanwhile, continues to operate its embassy in Warsaw and previously maintained a consulate-general in Gdansk.

Denmark's biggest exports include Ozempic, Carlsberg and Lego. But now, European leaders think it has something more valuable to sell: an immigration system tough and effective enough to neuter the hard right and keep mainstream parties in power.
    


            Mette Frederiksen, the Danish prime minister, has achieved what many center-left governments of recent years have found impossible: getting reelected. In an age when incumbents keep getting hammered at the ballot box, many in Europe are looking to the asylum policies of Frederiksen's Social Democrats – which won elections in 2019, 2022, and, polls show, are on course to win again in 2026 – as a model to imitate.
    


            Britain's Labour government – which has been hounded by the populist Reform UK party over its struggle to control illegal immigration – has been so impressed by the Danish model that it sent officials to find out how the system works.
    


            Announcing a radical overhaul of Britain's asylum system on Monday, Shabana Mahmood, the home secretary, said while Britain had “held rigidly to the old model, other countries have tightened theirs.” She singled out Denmark as a poster child.
    


            The old model referenced by Mahmood is a creature of Europe's post-war milieu. The United Nations Refugee Convention of 1951 applied only to Europe and sought to settle wartime refugees – primarily Jews who survived the Holocaust, ethnic Germans expelled from Eastern Europe and dissidents fleeing Soviet regimes. The treaty was expanded in 1967 to apply universally, in part to atone for colonialism.
    


            But the proliferation of conflict and climate disasters – coupled with cheap travel, rising rates of literacy, and the ease of online communication – has put immense strain on the post-war architecture of asylum. At the end of last year, 123 million people worldwide were forcibly displaced according to the UN, up from about 44 million people in 2010. “Our asylum system was not designed to cope with this,” Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer said bluntly Monday.
    


            Britain is now poised to embark on a policy route first charted by Denmark a decade ago. In 2015, Europe received its most requests for asylum in a single year since World War II, as civil wars in Syria and Libya helped spur around 1.3 million people to travel to the region, mostly from the Middle East. When Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel famously said “Wir schaffen das (We can do it)!” urging Germans to welcome in refugees, Denmark took a different approach.
    


            Under Lars Løkke Rasmussen, Frederiksen's predecessor as prime minister who then led the center-right Venstre party, Denmark aimed to reduce the number of asylum seekers, improve integration, and swiftly deport those who arrived illegally.
    


            Rasmussen, who is now the foreign minister, first made refugee status temporary, not permanent. Before 2015, refugees could stay in Denmark for five years, after which their residence permits would automatically become permanent. Now, residence permits last for only one or two years, and refugees must wait for eight years before they can apply for permanent status. Even then, it is not guaranteed: Refugees must be fluent in Danish and have held a full-time job for several years.
    


            Denmark has also made it harder for refugees to be joined by family members. Both must be aged 24 and above and have passed a Danish language test. The refugee must not have claimed government benefits for the past three years, and they must also put up a financial guarantee.
    


            Michala Clante Bendixen, head of the refugee advisory group Refugees Welcome Denmark, said removing the assumption that refugee status will become permanent has been detrimental to integration.
    


            “Attachment to the labor market, learning the language and understanding the society – these are very important things for successful integration,” Bendixen told CNN. But she feared the tightened requirements had “set the bar too high” for many new arrivals, discouraging some from trying at all – particularly older people with lower levels of education.
    


            “It creates a feeling of hopelessness. I've met so many refugees who say, ‘No matter what we do, it's never good enough. I have done everything they require of me, and still it's not enough,'” she said.
    


            Denmark has also been criticized for its policy on “ghettos” (now termed “parallel societies”), which allows the state to sell off or demolish housing estates where more than 50% of residents are from “non-Western” backgrounds. Successive Danish governments had worried about poor levels of integration in certain neighborhoods. In 2004, then-Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen warned of areas where “the men are unemployed, the women are isolated, and the families speak only the language of their home country.”
    


            A charitable interpretation of the “ghetto” law, introduced in 2018, is that it supports integration by encouraging people from different backgrounds to live together, not merely side-by-side. But not everyone is convinced. In February, a senior adviser to the EU's top court said the policy amounts to discrimination based on ethnic origin.
    


            Other laws have also been criticized by human rights groups. Under the so-called “jewelry law,” authorities can seize assets worth over 10,000 Danish Krone (around $1,500) to help cover the cost of asylum support. The measure was only applied 17 times over its first six years, but still has dark historical resonances, with some drawing comparisons to confiscations of valuables by the Nazi regime.
    


            Few dispute that Denmark's policies have achieved their stated aim. In 2014, Denmark granted refugee status to 6,031 people. By 2019, that figure had dropped to 1,737.
    


            While Denmark grants far more residence permits today than it did 30 years ago, the vast majority of these go to students and workers, not refugees. Of the 99,811 residence permits Denmark granted last year, just 859 went to asylum seekers – less than 1%.
    


            “Denmark in recent decades has shown that it is politically and practically feasible to transition to a system of overall higher migration, and more employment- and education-intensive immigration,” according to a report last month from Bruegel, a Brussels-based economic think tank.
    


            Over time, this has deterred refugees from seeking asylum in Denmark. Britain's Home Office said Denmark's policies had reduced asylum claims to a 40-year low and resulted in the removal of 95% of those whose claims are rejected. In 2024, there were four new asylum claims per 10,000 people in Denmark, compared to 16 per 10,000 in Britain, and 20 per 20,000 for the European Union as a whole.
    


            Although the Danish model has won the Social Democrats praise abroad, some are growing disillusioned at home. In local elections Tuesday, Frederiksen's party lost control of Copenhagen for the first time in more than a century. While much of the discontent is over the capital's high housing costs, analysts say the party's hardline stance on immigration has alienated its more progressive urban base.
    


            Whether the Danish model can be imported wholesale by other governments remains to be seen. Britain plans to quadruple the wait for permanent settlement from five years to 20 – much longer than the eight-year wait for refugees in Denmark. A refugee's status will be reviewed every two-and-a-half years; if their home country is deemed to have become safe during that time, they will be deported. Those seeking asylum could also be stripped of assets including jewelry to cover the costs of their accommodation.
    


            Bendixen warned the new 20-year path to permanent settlement would destroy refugees' sense of the future and make them “feel like they are second class citizens forever.”
    


            “Integration fails when you give young people the feeling that they don't belong. That's where you see gangs and crime and areas where people have their own rules. That's because they don't feel like they're part of society. A rule like this would make (that feeling) much, much stronger,” she said.
    


            Many UK Labour Party politicians would agree. Although Starmer, like Frederiksen, insists that a more stringent asylum system is compatible with the progressive values of compassion and tolerance, others say the proposals are needlessly cruel and will not have the desired effect.
    


            “Plans to leave refugees in a state of perpetual uncertainty about where and if they can rebuild their lives are not just performative cruelty, they are counterproductive to integration and the economy,” Stella Creasy, a Labour MP, said Monday.
    


            Alf Dubs, a Labour member of the House of Lords who came to Britain on the Kindertransport in 1939 fleeing the persecution of Jews in Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia, told the BBC that he was “depressed” by Labour's hardline turn, and called the new measures “a shabby thing.”

MOSCOW, November 19. /TASS/. The weapons used by Russian troops in the special military operation show high combat effectiveness, Chief of Russia's Missile Forces and Artillery, Hero of Russia, Lieutenant General Dmitry Klimenko said.

"All the existing weapons systems in service with the missile forces and artillery are successfully employed in the special military operation, showing high combat effectiveness and confirming their intended characteristics. They include upgraded 152mm Msta-S self-propelled howitzers, modern Tornado multiple launch rocket systems, and also the Iskander-M missile system," the commander said in an interview with the Defense Ministry's Krasnaya Zvezda newspaper on the occasion of Russia's Missile Forces and Artillery Day celebrated on November 19.

Defense manufacturers continue delivering highly mobile wheeled artillery weapons to Russian troops, such as the 152mm Malva system standardized with the Msta artillery gun, and also the 152mm Giatsint-K system aligned with the Giatsint family. This standardized approach helps deliver fire using all available types of munitions and allows for employing Krasnopol-M2 precision shells, he noted.

An ongoing analysis of combat experience gained and the results of the combat use of missile troops and artillery helps promptly upgrade these weapons amid a rapidly changing environment in the special military operation and refine directions of their further improvement, the general said.

Premier Danielle Smith said she and Prime Minister Mark Carney are keen to proceed with what she called a new vision for Alberta and the federal government.Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press

Ottawa and Alberta appear close to striking an energy accord long sought by Premier Danielle Smith to boost her province's oil and natural gas sector, with Privy Council Clerk Michael Sabia playing a key role in the negotiations, two sources say.

Two federal insiders said the broad outlines of the agreement, which would take the form of a memorandum of understanding, involve an oil pipeline running from Alberta to the northwest coast of British Columbia.

On the table to support it would be a limited exemption to the current ban on oil tankers on the B.C. coast, a plan to move ahead with changes to industrial carbon pricing in support of scaling up carbon capture technology, and a lowering or removal of the industrial emissions cap. 

Players in the federal and Alberta governments are expressing optimism that a deal is within reach and could be announced in time for next weekend's United Conservative Party of Alberta convention.

Alberta to draw up proposal for new oil pipeline to B.C. coast by May

The negotiations reflect a turnaround in relations between Alberta and Ottawa, which had soured under the Trudeau government's approach to energy and environmental policies. Since becoming Prime Minister, Mark Carney has taken a more collaborative approach, vowing to turn Canada into an energy superpower while still taking action on climate change. 

Energy projects have featured prominently in the list of infrastructure priorities that have been referred to the Major Projects Office, a central plank of Mr. Carney's strategy for asserting Canadian sovereignty.

Ms. Smith told reporters Monday she and Mr. Carney are very keen to proceed with what she called a new vision for her province and the federal government, and suggested it rested on him being able to win over naysayers within his own caucus. 

“It may well be that there are some members of his caucus who are not fully on board with that new vision, but I will know in the matter of days whether or not they're influential enough to change the direction that I think the Prime Minister and I want to go,” she said. 

Ms. Smith had originally said she thought there would be a deal by the Grey Cup, which was on Sunday. 

Mr. Carney is now headed to the United Arab Emirates, and then to South Africa for the G20 summit. He is slated to return on Nov. 24. The UCP convention begins on Nov. 28.

The sources said Mr. Sabia, the former CEO of Hydro-Québec, BCE Inc. and Quebec's pension fund, got involved in the Alberta negotiations after Canada-U.S. tariff talks broke down over an Ontario TV advertisement that angered President Donald Trump.

The Globe and Mail is not naming the sources, who were not authorized to discuss the confidential negotiations.

Natural Resources Minister Tim Hodgson is participating in some of the discussions with Mr. Sabia. But Mr. Carney and Ms. Smith have also been in regular contact, the sources said.

The sources said a northwest B.C. pipeline would require a private sector proponent, buy-in from coastal Indigenous communities and environmental approvals. It's unclear whether the MOU would require the approval of B.C.'s NDP government, which is publicly opposed. 

The MOU could include revival of the cancelled Keystone pipeline to the United States, but that remains part of the stalled trade talks with Washington, the sources said.

B.C. asks Ottawa to retain north coast tanker ban, blocking Alberta's pipeline ambitions

The two sources cautioned that talks are fluid and nothing has been written in stone. But the sources said Ottawa may be willing to grant some waivers, such as lifting the tanker ban for the specific area where the pipeline would emerge on the B.C. coast. 

B.C. Premier David Eby is adamantly opposed to lifting the ban. He told the B.C. NDP convention on the weekend that doing so would undermine all of the support First Nations and other coastal communities in B.C. have for the various resource projects already under way − some of which were referred to the federal Major Projects Office last week. 

The Prime Minister has also referred the Pathways Alliance carbon-capture initiative to Ottawa's Major Projects Office and the plan is now part of the talks for the MOU, the sources said. 

It is a 400-kilometre-long pipeline that would transport carbon trapped at oil-sands facilities to an underground hub near Cold Lake, Alta., with the aim of reducing emissions by 22 megatonnes a year.

The Trudeau government put in place an investment tax credit that would cover up to 50 per cent of the project's capital costs, and Alberta's government is offering an additional 12-per-cent capital-cost subsidy. However, Pathways members have expressed reluctance to proceed because of revenue uncertainty.

Alberta's pipeline pitch forces a thorny debate back into full view

The recent federal budget, however, promised to improve the industrial carbon pricing system, which could provide more certainty to the sector and increase its willingness to cover the costs.

Mr. Carney managed to pass his government's maiden budget on Monday thanks in part to support from Green Party Leader Elizabeth May, after he promised to respect previous commitments to emissions reductions targets. 

Mr. Carney was asked Tuesday how he could square that promise with a proposed new pipeline for Alberta.

“We're part of an energy transition, we're going to help to lead it,” he told reporters. 

“That means Alberta, that means Quebec, that means Ontario, that means all of Canada, means all forms of energy.”

China has warned there is “no market” for Japanese seafood exports, the latest veiled threat from Beijing as its diplomatic spat with Tokyo escalates over recent comments by Japan's leader on defending Taiwan.
    


            The two neighbors have been engaged in a rapidly spiraling dispute after Japanese leader Sanae Takaichi, in response to a question in parliament, said that a Chinese attack on Taiwan would count as “a situation threatening Japan's survival,” and thus could trigger a military response from Tokyo.
    


            Beijing views the self-governing democracy of Taiwan as its territory and has vowed to take control of the island, by force if necessary. For Beijing, Taiwan's sovereignty is the most sensitive issue in its relations with other nations – a “red line” not to be crossed.
    


            For more than a week, China and its state media has issued near daily denunciations of Takaichi as well as threats to economically punish Tokyo unless the comments are retracted.
    


            Seafood emerged as the latest pressure point at a regular press briefing on Wednesday from China's foreign ministry.
    


            “Due to the erroneous remarks made by Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi on important Taiwan issues, there has been strong public outrage in China,” spokesperson Mao Ning told reporters. “Under the current circumstances, even if Japanese seafood were exported to China, there would be no market for it.”
    


            Mao was responding to reports earlier that day in Japanese media that China had already informed Tokyo that it planned to ban seafood exports from Japan. Both NHK and Kyodo ran the reports, citing sources.
    


            However Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara told reporters Tokyo has yet to receive any confirmation from the Chinese government on the matter.
    


            Mao's response did not confirm a ban was in place, but it has raised the prospect that one might be on its way as well as further punitive measures.
    


            “Japan should first retract its erroneous remarks and take concrete actions to safeguard the political foundation of China-Japan relations; otherwise, China will have no choice but to take further measures,” Mao said.
    


            China had only partly resumed imports of seafood from Japan earlier this year after banning them in August 2023 in response to Tokyo's decision to begin releasing treated radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear plant.
    


            Japan's devastating 2011 earthquake and tsunami caused water within the plant to be contaminated with highly radioactive material. Tokyo had argued that it had treated the water properly, but Beijing had long led regional opposition to the water being returned to the ocean.
    


            The threat of a new seafood ban comes after Beijing last week advised its citizens against travelling to Japan.
    


            Although the move is non-binding, it is hugely symbolic – nearly 7.5 million travelers from China visited Japan between January and September this year, by far the highest count of any country or region, according to official data cited by Japanese public broadcaster NHK.
    


            Chinese airlines including Air China, China Eastern and China Southern later published notices on their websites offering customers refunds or free changes on certain tickets to Japan, Chinese state broadcaster CCTV reported.
    


            Japanese companies are starting to report cancellations.
    


Japan's new leader drums to relieve stress. She has many reasons to reach for her sticks



            Tokyo-based tour operator East Japan International Travel Service said it had lost 70% of its bookings for the remainder of the year, because of the ongoing row between Japan and China.
    


            Yu Jinxin, the company's vice president, told CNN it was “a huge loss for us”, adding Chinese tour groups are a key part of their business.
    


            “We can withstand a short-term impact of one to two months, but if the situation becomes prolonged, the financial strain on our operations will be significant,” Yu added.
    


            Previous Japanese leaders have avoided discussing Taiwan in the context of a military response to avoid ruffling feathers in China – Japan's biggest trade partner.
    


            Takaichi, a hawk who has pushed to strengthen Japan's defense capacity, visited Taiwan earlier this year – before she became Prime Minister – and called for cooperation on “defense challenges,” which Beijing condemned at the time.
    


            She has previously criticized Beijing's increasing military presence in East Asia, and during the APEC summit, she met with Taiwan's representative, again angering China.
    


            She met Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the same summit, at which she said she had asked China to resume imports of Japanese beef and seafood imports.

MOSCOW, November 19. /TASS/. The Russian oil pipeline operator Transneft will transfer 12 mln metric tons of oil products from rail to pipeline transport to expedite deliveries to marine terminals, the Novorossiysk Commercial Seaport (with Transneft as its controlling shareholder) said in the presentation at the Russian Transport forum.

"Transneft is working continuously on construction of trunk product pipelines, which contributes to lower load on railways and acceleration of petroleum product deliveries to marine terminals," the port said.

Agreements are being reached at present to build petroleum product pipelines from refineries in the Krasnodar Region to Novorossiysk at two stages. The first one will be until January 1, 2027 for 3.7 mln metric tons of diesel fuel, and the second one until January 1, 2030 for three mln metric tons of gasoline. Furthermore, the Samara-Volgograd product pipeline to pump 5.3 mln metric tons of diesel fuel will be constructed by 2030.

TASS is the general information partner of the 19th Russian Transport International Forum and Exhibition.

Editor's note: This is a breaking story and will be updated regularly.

Russia carried out a mass overnight attack on multiple Ukrainian regions on Nov. 19, leaving at least 25 civilians dead and 141 injured, and causing widespread infrastructure damage and triggering emergency power outages.

Russia launched 476 drones and 48 missiles at Ukraine, including 47 cruise missiles and one ballistic missile, the Air Force reported.

Ukrainian air defenses intercepted 442 drones, 34 Kh-101 cruise missiles, and seven Kalibr cruise missiles. Meanwhile, seven missiles and 34 drones struck 14 locations, while debris from downed drones and missiles fell on six additional sites.

Oblasts in western Ukraine, including Ternopil, Khmelnytskyi, Ivano-Frankivsk, and Lviv, located over 500 kilometers (about 300 miles) from the front line and the Russian border, were affected.

The Russian attack on Ternopil killed at least 25 people, including three children, and injured 93 others, among them 15 children, according to Ukraine's Emergency Service.

Two nine-story residential buildings were damaged in the strike. In one of them, the damage extended from the third to the ninth floor, according to Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko.

The Air Force later confirmed that the attack on apartment buildings in Ternopil was carried out using Russian Kh-101 cruise missiles, launched from strategic aircraft located in Russia's Vologda and Astrakhan oblasts.

Rescue workers continue search-and-recovery efforts, with people still trapped beneath the debris.

The Ternopil Oblast Military Administration also urged residents to stay indoors and keep their windows closed, warning that the level of harmful substances in the city's air had risen to six times the normal limit following the Russian attack.

Local authorities designated Nov. 19–21 as days of mourning for the victims of the Russian attack.

"In light of the tragedy, all entertainment events in Ternopil have been canceled, and government buildings will lower their flags to half-mast," the statement said.

Around midnight local time, Russian drones attacked the city of Kharkiv, injuring at least 46 people, including two girls aged 9 and 13, according to Governor Oleh Syniehubov.

The Slobidskyi and Osnovianskyi districts were targeted, with Russian forces launching 19 Geran-2 drones. The strikes damaged a high-rise residential building, a hospital, and a school.

In Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast, Russian strikes injured three people, including two children, Governor Svitlana Onyshchuk reported.

A large fire was reported in Lviv and pictures posted on Telegram by Lviv City Council deputy Ihor Zinkevich, showed a huge plume of smoke across the city as the sun rose. 

"Close the windows, as the air may be polluted," he warned residents. 

Lviv Mayor Andrii Sadovyi later said a warehouse storing tyres had been hit and that there were no casualties. 

The Russian strike in Lviv has also destroyed a newly opened office of Ukrposhta, Ukraine's state-owned postal service. While no employees were injured in the attack, approximately 900 parcels were destroyed, according to company CEO Igor Smelyansky.

Smelyansky added that the office would "definitely be restored," though he did not provide a specific timeline for its reopening.

Local authorities in the Lviv and Ivano-Frankivsk oblasts also reported attacks on energy and other critical infrastructure.

The Russian attack also damaged equipment at a thermal power plant operated by DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy company. 

The strike occurred as temperatures dropped to -3°C (27°F) overnight.

While the company did not specify the region where the damage took place, it confirmed that this was the fifth attack on DTEK's thermal power plants since October.

DTEK also reported that on Nov. 19, during the restoration of an energy facility in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, a Russian strike injured a team of workers. One worker is in serious condition, while the other four sustained concussions and shrapnel wounds.

In Khmelnytskyi Oblast, nearly 2,000 residents across 27 settlements were left without power due to the Russian attack, with power lines also damaged in the Shepetivka district, Governor Serhii Tiurin reported.

"Russia is again attacking our energy infrastructure. Because of this, emergency power outages have been introduced in a number of regions of Ukraine," the Energy Ministry said.

Vitaly Zaichenko, head of Ukrenergo, Ukraine's state-grid operator, said Russia is attacking Ukraine's energy sector in "waves," warning that the load on western regions will increase as a result of the recent strikes.

"Russia is launching waves of attack starting from the east, then hitting the center, and then the western part of Ukraine," Zaichenko told the Kyiv Independent.

While this attack was smaller than previous ones in October, western Ukraine will experience "load shedding" for the first time this autumn, where power is cut to consumers to stabilize the grid, he said. But he expects it to only last one day.

Russia regularly launches large-scale attacks on Ukrainian cities and in recent months, Moscow has intensified attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure in an attempt to plunge Ukraine into another harsh winter.

"Every brazen attack on normal life (of Ukrainians) shows that the pressure on Russia is still insufficient. Effective sanctions and support for Ukraine can change that," President Volodymyr Zelensky said, stressing Ukraine's need for additional air defense.

"Russia must be held accountable for its actions, and we must focus on everything that strengthens us — everything that allows us to shoot down Russian missiles, neutralize Russian drones, and stop their assaults," the president added.

Poland's armed forces confirmed it had scrambled fighter jets in its own airspace in response to the Russian attack.

Romania also scrambled four military aircraft after detecting a Russian drone violating its airspace.

Corneliu Pavel, a spokesperson for the Romanian Defense Ministry, told Digi24 that Romanian forces had authorization to shoot down the drone but did not, as "it appeared only periodically and was only visible on radar."

Two F-16s from the Romanian Air Force were sent to patrol the area later. The Romanian Defense Ministry reported that no aircraft crashes were detected.

Editor's note: This is a breaking story and will be updated regularly.

Russia carried out a mass overnight attack on multiple Ukrainian regions on Nov. 19, leaving at least 26 civilians dead and 141 injured, and causing widespread infrastructure damage and triggering emergency power outages.

Russia launched 476 drones and 48 missiles at Ukraine, including 47 cruise missiles and one ballistic missile, the Air Force reported.

Ukrainian air defenses intercepted 442 drones, 34 Kh-101 cruise missiles, and seven Kalibr cruise missiles. Meanwhile, seven missiles and 34 drones struck 14 locations, while debris from downed drones and missiles fell on six additional sites.

Oblasts in western Ukraine, including Ternopil, Khmelnytskyi, Ivano-Frankivsk, and Lviv, located over 500 kilometers (about 300 miles) from the front line and the Russian border, were affected.

The Russian attack on Ternopil killed at least 26 people, including three children, and injured 93 others, among them 18 children, according to Ukraine's Emergency Service.

Two nine-story residential buildings were damaged in the strike. In one of them, the damage extended from the third to the ninth floor, according to Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko.

Authorities believe there are still 26 people trapped beneath the rubble of one of the buildings. Klymenko described the destruction he encountered on the site. 

"I walked between the burnt walls —it was a terrible feeling," he said. "In each apartment — a whole life that Russia destroyed in an instant."

Residents tried to leap from high-story windows to escape the fire after the Russian strike on the building, Klymenko said. The fire reportedly killed 19 people. 

The Air Force later confirmed that the attack on apartment buildings in Ternopil was carried out using Russian Kh-101 cruise missiles, launched from strategic aircraft located in Russia's Vologda and Astrakhan oblasts.

Rescue workers continue search-and-recovery efforts and expect to be working throughout the night. 

The Ternopil Oblast Military Administration also urged residents to stay indoors and keep their windows closed, warning that the level of harmful substances in the city's air had risen to six times the normal limit following the Russian attack.

Local authorities designated Nov. 19–21 as days of mourning for the victims of the Russian attack.

"In light of the tragedy, all entertainment events in Ternopil have been canceled, and government buildings will lower their flags to half-mast," the statement said.

 Selective Proliferation Will Strengthen the Global Order, Not End It

 Moritz S. Graefrath and Mark A. Raymond

Few scenarios scare pundits and policymakers as much as the prospect of nuclear proliferation. Russia's willingness to dangle the threat of deploying tactical nuclear weapons in its war against Ukraine, U.S. President Donald Trump's ambiguous interest in nuclear testing, and the imminent expiration of the 2010 New START treaty (which limits the size of Russian and U.S. nuclear arsenals) have reminded the world of the abiding destructive potential of nuclear weapons and reanimated fears of their use. American leaders are convinced that the spread of nuclear weapons would deeply hurt U.S. strategic interests and further destabilize the already fragile global order. In recent months, they have doubled down on their commitment to preventing proliferation, and the June strikes against nuclear sites in Iran have shown that Washington will use force to prevent more countries from acquiring the bomb.

For decades, the United States invested in a nuclear order built around nonproliferation, even as Cold War disarmament agreements such as the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty expired. Opposing proliferation among unreliable states and adversaries makes sense, but a blanket opposition to the further spread of nuclear weapons obscures the significant benefits they can bestow. The United States would do well to reconsider its strict adherence to nonproliferation and encourage a small set of allies—namely Canada, Germany, and Japan—to go nuclear. For Washington, selective nuclear proliferation would allow these partners to take on larger roles in regional defense and decrease their military dependence on the United States. For these allies, in turn, acquiring nuclear weapons provides the most dependable protection against the threats of regional foes, such as China and Russia, as well as a United States less committed to its traditional alliances.

Skeptics and nuclear pessimists might blanch at the idea of a world with more nuclear-armed powers, but such concerns are less warranted when proliferation is pursued selectively. Canada, Germany, and Japan have proven track records of rational policymaking and domestic stability that will make both nuclear accidents and any spiral of uncontrolled escalation unlikely. And, if carefully managed, there is ample reason to believe that proliferation in these countries would not lead to widespread efforts by others to develop their own bombs.

Far from ushering in a frightening new era of global instability, selective proliferation would help uphold the post–World War II order. Were Canada, Germany, and Japan to acquire nuclear weapons, they would rebalance global military capabilities in favor of a coalition of states committed to the rules-based system and to stopping the erosion of its key norms, especially territorial integrity. Selective proliferation would thus revitalize the increasingly brittle post-1945 order that has so benefited the United States and its allies.

Senior U.S. officials have repeatedly emphasized the need to shift the burden of continental defense onto European allies and decrease their military dependence on the United States. Confronted by the geopolitical challenge of a rising China in East Asia and pressed for resources to address issues at home, Washington has come to see ending European free-riding as a top strategic priority. What stands in the way of Europe's ability to provide for its own security today—and thus blocks a significant U.S. retrenchment—is the lack of German nuclear forces. Throughout the Cold War, U.S. leaders had hoped to withdraw American forces from Europe but determined that unless Germany acquired a nuclear deterrent, the continent would not be able to guarantee its own security. As the historian Marc Trachtenberg has noted, the United States rightly judged that British and French nuclear forces “could not provide the necessary degree of reassurance” that Europe would be able to deter the Soviet Union and its vast nuclear arsenal. Today, the same roadblock remains. Encouraging Germany to develop its own nuclear weapons would finally create the kind of self-sufficient Europe that enables an American exit.

German leaders and the German public recognize that military dependence on the United States leaves their country vulnerable to Washington's whims. Shortly after his election in February 2025, Chancellor Friedrich Merz announced that it was time to “achieve independence” from the United States, and he has since become an outspoken proponent of substantial rearmament. But it will take a long time to build up Germany's conventional capabilities, and Berlin still lacks a clear vision for how to meet the ambitious defense spending target of five percent of GDP that Merz and other European leaders agreed to at a NATO summit in June. Germany's ongoing commitments to provide war materiel to Ukraine and the population's reluctance to undertake military service hinder a speedy conventional military buildup. The development of an independent nuclear force would safeguard Germany against the possibility of a sudden U.S. withdrawal from Europe while offering a feasible and meaningful way to fulfill the five percent pledge.

Japanese proliferation will go a long way toward achieving the United States' main goal in East Asia, namely, the containment of China through strong local alliances. From Washington's perspective, the primary threat posed by Beijing is that it might achieve regional dominance and develop the military potential to seriously threaten the United States and its interests by, for example, disrupting semiconductor supply chains or establishing forward bases beyond its territory in East Asia and even further afield. Such Chinese regional hegemony would pose a major challenge to the United States.

Japan already enjoys the defensive benefit of being an archipelago country separated from its adversaries by the sea. If combined with independent nuclear capabilities, that advantage would effectively guarantee Japan's security in the face of outside threats—and ensure that it does not fall under Chinese control. Beyond better defending itself, a nuclear-armed Japan would provide a more credible and immediate form of extended deterrence to East Asia than the United States can provide. China might doubt Washington's willingness to risk nuclear war over developments in East Asia, but Japan's proximity and direct stake in regional stability render its commitments far more credible.



A nuclear-armed Japan would also insert an extra layer in crisis escalation scenarios, allowing an effective response to Chinese aggression without directly drawing in the United States. When contemplating an attack on Japan, China would be forced to consider the monumental costs of Japanese retaliation independent of any additional American support. Having nuclear weapons would also equip Japan, and perhaps East Asia more broadly, to handle a sudden change in Washington's security commitment. The Trump administration's newest National Defense Strategy prioritizes the defense of the U.S. homeland and the Western Hemisphere over the threats emanating from China and Russia, signaling a potentially seismic shift in orientation.

In North America, Canadian proliferation would enhance American homeland security. Given the integration of the Canadian and American militaries within NATO and the bilateral air defense system NORAD, the two countries would be fighting together in virtually any conceivable hemispheric defense scenario. Although Canada does not face immediate threats to its territorial integrity from Russia or China, its relations with both countries have deteriorated significantly over the past decade. A Canadian nuclear deterrent reduces the chance that the United States would be called on to defend its continental neighbor, effectively freeing up American capabilities and removing an avenue of potential geopolitical encroachment. American support for a Canadian nuclear deterrent would also provide crucial reassurance about Washington's commitment to continental defense at a time when the neighbors' bilateral relationship is under strain.

For Canada in turn, possessing nuclear weapons signals to the United States that it, too, accepts shared responsibility for continental defense and that Ottawa can deter potential aggressors without American support. As Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney put it in March, Canada's “old relationship” with the United States is “over.” Going nuclear would prepare Ottawa to face this new world by reconfiguring the continental partnership and helping the country go it alone. Further, the challenges of meeting NATO's five percent spending target are arguably more significant for Canada than they are for Germany. A modest nuclear deterrent offers a solution to this challenge that also results in a meaningful strategic asset in Canada's arsenal.

Canada, Germany, and Japan each possesses the scientific and industrial capacity to successfully develop nuclear weapons on its own. For instance, Canada's role as a major supplier of fissile material provides the basis for a joint effort to make these new nuclear capabilities a reality. What the three allies would need—and what the United States can and should provide—is public support and diplomatic cover for their transition to becoming nuclear-armed states, as well as technical and doctrinal guidance to ensure robust command and control safeguards.

Traditionally, nuclear proliferation has been understood as a risk to the stability of the international order. As states acquire nuclear capabilities, regional and global balances of power shift, calling into question existing security arrangements. A state with a nuclear deterrent, the thinking goes, can behave predatorily since it is now insulated from attempts to rein it in. This conventional view is wrong—or at the very least too simplistic—as it assumes all proliferators will behave the same way. When states committed to defending international rules and norms acquire nuclear capabilities, proliferation, in fact, increases the stability and strength of the global order.

Canada, Germany, and Japan are among the leading states committed to the rules-based international order. All three frame their foreign policies and even their state identities in terms of good international citizenship. Select nuclear proliferation in these states would rebalance military capabilities and create a unified coalition of nuclear powers committed to thwarting potential revisionists. Such a coalition would help prevent further erosion of the rules, norms, and institutions of the post-1945 order, including the norm against conquest. In addition to the material sources of stability it would provide, selective proliferation would thus strengthen the normative sources of stability essential to international order.

Selective nuclear proliferation should thus be framed and understood as an investment in the revitalization of that order. Effectively, Canada, Germany, and Japan would be helping to fill the gaps that have led Russia to see more favorable conditions for revisionism and that could lead China to make a similar calculation.

Many of the typical concerns raised by opponents of nuclear proliferation do not apply to selective proliferation by U.S. allies. For instance, there is no reason to fear that Canadian, German, or Japanese nuclear weapons would end up in the hands of rogue states or terrorist organizations; all three are paragons of responsibility, state capacity, and domestic stability. There is also no need to worry about the rationality of these states. If North Korean leader Kim Jong Un can exercise prudence and caution with regard to his nuclear arsenal, leaders in Ottawa, Berlin, and Tokyo can reasonably be expected to do the same.

Another concern is that if a few states pursue nuclear capabilities, a plethora of others will then move to do the same. This argument is unconvincing. Knock-on proliferation is typically the result of preexisting rivalries and heavily conditioned by geographic contiguity, as exemplified by Pakistan's pursuit of a bomb in response to Indian proliferation. Canadian proliferation is unlikely to spur, say, Mexico, to pursue its own bomb. The European states that would have the greatest incentive to counter German proliferation—the United Kingdom and France—already have their own nuclear forces. Other possible proliferators, such as Poland, might be convinced to forgo an independent nuclear weapons program with multi- or bilateral nuclear sharing agreements. In East Asia, an acquisition of nuclear weapons by Japan might push South Korea to act on its long-held nuclear ambitions, but Seoul's integration into the American security architecture substantially reduces its incentives to do so. Japan's geographic advantage and the fact that it is not stuck in a frozen conflict (as South Korea is with a nuclear-armed North Korea) make it a more attractive candidate for selective proliferation than South Korea. To be sure, if Seoul decided to forge ahead and build a bomb, it would also be a safe and reliable nuclear custodian. Although Taiwan might theoretically want to follow suit, it has no plausible pathway to act upon this desire because of its precarious geopolitical position in regard to China.

The potential for accidents involving nuclear weapons remains a reasonable concern. Although it is true that the spread of nuclear weapons would technically increase the possibility of inadvertent nuclear war, the risk remains so small that it would likely be outweighed by the tangible benefits to international stability and security. Even during the height of the Cold War, a time fraught with immense strategic and ideological rivalry, the two superpowers successfully avoided a nuclear exchange. One of the virtues of selective nuclear proliferation is that Canada, Germany, and Japan are among the most well-equipped to minimize additional risk. All have highly professional militaries, robust civilian control of those armed forces, and foreign ministries highly skilled in peaceful conflict resolution.

Other objections do not withstand scrutiny. For example, some U.S. experts have opposed proliferation among American allies on the ground that it would undermine the United States' influence, specifically over Germany and Japan. The claim conflates strategic instruments with objectives. Washington's fundamental aim in Europe and East Asia is to prevent any single state from dominating either region. Although American influence over allies offers an indirect and uncertain path to preventing the rise of a regional hegemon, nuclear weapons in Germany and Japan would virtually guarantee that result. In other words, selective proliferation sacrifices some U.S. influence, but only in exchange for the objective it was designed to achieve in the first place.

The most understandable hurdle—and potentially the most difficult to overcome—is public opposition to proliferation. Japan's experience of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki remains central to its collective memory. Post-1945 pacifism and general skepticism about nuclear energy predispose many Germans to oppose an independent deterrent. And Canada has long resisted even hosting nuclear weapons on its territory, let alone acquiring its own. Overcoming this apprehension will no doubt be difficult, and states will have to convince skeptical citizens that the acquisition of nuclear weapons will not just keep them safer but also boost the overall health of the rules-based order.

Implementing selective proliferation will not be easy or without risk. An immediate practical consideration is that Canada, Germany, and Japan would each need to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, in which they agreed not to develop a nuclear bomb. Commitment to the proper process for withdrawing from the treaty under international law would signal their intent to stabilize the international order and strengthen international security rather than weaken both. To the extent possible, NPT withdrawals should be carefully broached to key allies in advance to minimize alarm. Although it is unrealistic to expect all other countries to accept such withdrawals, pursuing nuclear proliferation in a responsible and transparent way would signal each country's good intentions. It is here that American diplomatic cover can prove particularly valuable, coordinating with France and the United Kingdom to ensure that the new nuclear states do not become the target of United Nations Security Council enforcement measures.

To provide as much reassurance to skeptical states as possible, the three proliferators should consider adopting a “no first use” policy, at least while they remain under the American nuclear umbrella. While NATO was unwilling to commit to such a policy during the Cold War, Canada, Germany, and Japan face less stringent security challenges, at least at present, and can therefore contemplate taking this step in order to signal their commitment to maintaining the status quo.

Selective nuclear proliferation requires careful management to fulfill its potential, but it offers genuine ground for optimism. The case for it remains as controversial as ever, but it does matter greatly which countries get the bomb. If the proliferators are allied, stable governments and responsible members of the international community, then more nuclear weapons might indeed be better.

WASHINGTON—Sanctions imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump in October against two Russian oil companies are “having their intended effect” on the country's oil revenues, according to a Treasury Department market reaction report.

Unelected and lacking popular support, President Volodymyr Zelensky's chief of staff has amassed a level of power rarely seen in modern Ukraine. Now, he faces a push to finally leave.

President Volodymyr Zelensky's chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, has consolidated an unprecedented level of power within Ukraine's government — wielding influence across parliament, the Cabinet, and key state institutions.

Despite his dominance, however, Yermak has remained a controversial figure, often viewed with skepticism both inside Ukraine and abroad.

Yermak's reach extends into law enforcement through trusted deputies and places him at the center of high-level diplomatic meetings, frequently sidelining Ukraine's traditional foreign service.

His role as Zelensky's gatekeeper has made him indispensable, but also a subject of ridicule and frustration among allies, who complain that his ubiquity far outstrips his skills.

"We have to deal with him, he's Zelensky's man," a senior European official told the Kyiv Independent. "We don't have a choice."

Another European diplomat, when discussing the strained Ukraine-U.S. relationship and potential paths forward, said that "anything is better than sending Yermak (to Washington) again."

Both officials said Yermak isn't looked upon favorably in Brussels and Washington. In Ukraine, his reputation is somehow even worse.

Yermak's far-reaching powers and desire for control have been widely discussed among Ukrainian and foreign officials. Those who spoke with the Kyiv Independent have said with confidence that it was him who pulled the trigger on the recent attack against the country's anti-corruption institutions.

The same people point to Yermak's role as one of the reasons the attack failed. 

Yermak did not respond to requests for comment.

Now, as Ukraine has been shaken with the biggest corruption scandal of Zelensky's presidency, with the president's inner circle implicated, Yermak is in the hot seat — even though he was not named among the accused.

The Kyiv Independent sources have said that, as the president is scrambling to save face, he is finally considering letting Yermak go.

"Andriy Yermak is so influential and is so deep in so many issues inside the country, that it is impossible for such a large-scale corruption scheme to operate without (his) deep knowledge and understanding," Daria Kaleniuk, executive director of Ukraine's Anti-Corruption Action Center, told the Kyiv Independent.

“For the president to prove that he's not part of the scheme and he's not corrupt, he needs to get rid of all these corrupt inner circle friends. As simple as that,” she added.

“Including Mr. Yermak.”

Yermak's notorious omnipresence may be what finally sinks him: According to the Kyiv Independent's source close to the ongoing large-scale corruption investigation that shook Ukraine last week, the president's chief of staff comes up in it, too.

Within the investigation, the Anti-Corruption Bureau has published tapes alleging that the president's friends and top government officials had been laundering money and getting kickbacks from state contracts. Over $100 million has allegedly been laundered.

The alleged ringleader was Timur Mindich, a close associate of Zelensky and a co-owner of the president's former Kvartal 95 production company. Mindich had called Yermak “his friend” in the past.

Mindich was tipped off and left the country before he could be detained.

Those implicated also include Zelensky's associate and former Deputy Prime Minister Oleksii Chernyshov, Justice Minister Herman Halushchenko, who served as energy minister until earlier this year, Energy Minister Svitlana Hrynchuk, and Rustem Umerov, former defense minister and current secretary of the National Security and Defense Council.

The investigators made it clear that the released part isn't all they have, and the country has been guessing who else could have been involved.

According to the Kyiv Independent source in law enforcement, some of the money from the scheme was used to cover the construction of four lavish houses outside Kyiv, overseen by Chernyshov. One of the houses, the source claimed, was meant for Yermak.

The Kyiv Independent reached out to Yermak for comment.

Corruption, illicit enrichment, and bribery have surrounded Yermak's office for years.

Yermak's former deputy, Andriy Smyrnov, has been charged with illicit enrichment, money laundering, and bribery, and two other former deputies — Kyrylo Tymoshenko and Rostyslav Shurma — have been investigated in corruption cases but have not been officially charged.

During Yermak's tenure, some of his associates have also accumulated significant wealth.

Artem Kolyubayev, a film producer and former business partner of Yermak, has drastically expanded his business empire during Yermak's time in office, investing in real estate and drone production, according to a 2023 investigation by Bihus.info.

Kolyubayev also became the head of the Council for the State Support of Cinematography in 2021 and received state funding for his films during the full-scale invasion.

For Yermak's critics, corruption cases against his top subordinates and allies and the President's Office's reluctance to fire officials charged with corruption show that either Yermak tolerates corruption or is implicated himself.

“It's not a secret that personnel decisions in the country, both in the President's Office and in the government, as well as in state-owned companies, are impossible without Andriy Yermak,” Kaleniuk said.

A source in law enforcement told the Kyiv Independent that they don't expect Yermak to be fired, despite reports to the contrary.

"What will (Zelensky) do without Yermak?" they asked with a smile.

Acquainted with Yermak since 2010, the president became the sole golden ticket that brought the former lawyer and film producer with no prior political experience to the summit of power.

Yermak rose through the ranks by picking up workstreams above his area of expertise and making sure that the president's view is executed and unchallenged.

"He presented himself as someone absolutely devoted to the president — as the perfect executor," political analyst Volodymyr Fesenko told the Kyiv Independent. "His main goal is to become the most acceptable, comfortable, and effective tool for Zelensky. He does not claim any special role for himself."

Taking over the president's foreign agenda and dealings with Russia and the U.S., Yermak was able to earn the president's wholehearted trust.


"Yermak is the main button on Zelensky's remote control."
    

Eventually, Yermak was appointed as the president's chief of staff in 2020, replacing his flamboyant predecessor Andriy Bohdan.

He hasn't let go of the president's ear ever since.

The secret to Yermak's influence is that he panders to Zelensky's wishes, which keeps him in a psychologically comforting state, a former employee of the President's Office told the Kyiv Independent.

"Yermak's strength is that he portrays himself as the ideal operator who gets things done," Fesenko told the Kyiv Independent. "Yermak is the main button on Zelensky's remote control."

He added that Yermak implements Zelensky's wishes even if he disagrees with them and that his "power lies in always being near the president and carrying out whatever he says."

Yermak is also convenient for Zelensky because he takes the heat upon himself, absorbing public criticism, another former employee said.

Step by step, Yermak has been accumulating unprecedented power, de facto becoming Ukraine's second-in-command after the president.

People who used to work in the President's Office told the Kyiv Independent that Zelensky is not deeply involved in the daily mechanics of governance, with Yermak being largely responsible for managing the practical aspects of administration and actual governing.

One of the sources described Zelensky as the chief executive officer who sets strategy, and Yermak as the chief operating officer who controls and executes.

One example of this power dynamic is that Zelensky sets the goal of acquiring military aid from allies, and Yermak meets top Western officials to implement the strategy.

Despite Yermak's immense power, he is not acting independently from Zelensky — in contrast with his predecessor Bohdan, former employees of the President's Office told the Kyiv Independent.

One of the sources described Zelensky and Yermak as "yin and yang" and quipped that they are one entity, not two.

Fesenko argued that Yermak is unlikely to launch a career independent from the president.

"Yermak is the number two," Fesenko said. "He chose that role a long time ago. He understands that his peak is to be Zelensky's right-hand man, his main instrument. That's his ceiling."

One of the reasons for this dependence on Zelensky is Yermak's unpopularity. Only 17.5% Ukrainians trusted Yermak, and 67% distrusted him, according to a poll published by the Razumkov Center in March.

One reason why the President's Office wields so much power is that Zelensky's Servant of the People party obtained 254 out of 450 seats in the 2019 parliamentary elections, the most recent to date.

In contrast, Zelensky's predecessor, Petro Poroshenko, did not hold a parliamentary majority and had to form a coalition with other parties, which limited his power.

Another reason is that, due to Russia's full-scale invasion, the incumbent administration got unprecedented wartime powers with the implementation of martial law in 2022.

Volodymyr Ariev, a lawmaker from Poroshenko's European Solidarity party and an opponent of Zelensky, argued that the current President's Office has effectively usurped power.

"Everything is controlled by the President's Office," he told the Kyiv Independent. "The President's Office decides everything, not parliament or the Cabinet."

Fesenko said that "the influence of the parliamentary opposition is the weakest since Ukraine became independent.” He added that the opposition was much stronger even under the notorious pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych, ousted during the 2014 EuroMaidan Revolution.

As a result, it's the President's Office that handpicks ministers and tells lawmakers what laws to support, lawmakers from Zelensky's governing party told the Kyiv Independent.

In July, the Cabinet was reshuffled, and Yulia Svyrydenko replaced Denys Shmyhal as prime minister.

Although Shmyhal was not an independent figure, Svyrydenko is considered to be close specifically to Yermak, opposition lawmakers Yaroslav Yurchyshyn and Yaroslav Zheleznyak told the Kyiv Independent.

Svyrydenko was Yermak's deputy from 2020 to 2021 and later joined the government.

Fesenko said that Svyrydenko had earned the trust of Yermak and Zelensky by successfully negotiating a minerals deal with Trump's team earlier this year. She is seen as more effective and devoted than Shmyhal.

"It's not just loyalty — it's true devotion," he added, describing Svyrydenko. "When she's given assignments, she carries them out meticulously. The bosses like that."

Proteges and associates of Yermak also lead the tax, customs and financial monitoring agencies, as well as the Anti-Monopoly Committee and the State Property Fund, according to the news outlets Ukrainska Pravda and Dzerkalo Tyzhnia.


"...it is no secret that the government was formed mainly after certain candidates were approved in the President's Office."
    

Vitaliy Shabunin, head of the Anti-Corruption Action Center's executive board, argued that the monopolization of power in the hands of Yermak and the President's Office is unprecedented.

After the recent corruption scandal, however, Zelensky's party began to protest.

"It's a huge blow, but the worst part of it is that I'm not sure that we are at the end of it, it might still be unfolding," a pro-government Ukrainian lawmaker speaking on condition of anonymity told the Kyiv Independent.

“I believe that the resignation of Mr. Yermak in this case would definitely bring down this certain agitation around the government, because it is no secret that the government was formed mainly after certain candidates were approved in the President's Office,” pro-government lawmaker Fedir Venislavskyi said on Nov. 18.

The President's Office's control is not limited to the legislative and executive branches — law enforcement and the judiciary are also under Yermak's thumb.

The central figure accused of running the law enforcement system in the interests of the President's Office is Zelensky's Deputy Chief of Staff Oleh Tatarov.

Tatarov allegedly maintains influence over the State Investigation Bureau, the National Police, and the Security Service of Ukraine, according to anti-corruption activists and journalist investigations.

Although there have been reports on an alleged conflict between Yermak and Tatarov, the Kyiv Independent's sources in law enforcement did not outright confirm that such a conflict influences their power dynamic.

The sources argued that Zelensky and Yermak desperately needed Tatarov because they saw him as the only person who knew Ukraine's law enforcement system well enough to run it in their interests. The sources described Tatarov as "clever" and "professional."

This might explain why Zelensky and Yermak have refused to suspend or fire Tatarov despite corruption scandals and controversies surrounding him.

Tatarov was charged in 2020 with giving a bribe to an official before he joined the President's Office. Prosecutors and courts obstructed the case, and it was eventually closed in 2022.

However, Yermak is gradually sidelining his powerful deputy.

The new Prosecutor General Ruslan Kravchenko, appointed in June, is seen as a Yermak protégé, according to anti-corruption activists and pro-government lawmakers.

“Ruslan Kravchenko, who was appointed in summer this year with one goal to dismantle the independence of NABU and Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (SAPO), directly reports to Andriy Yermak,” Kaleniuk said.

In July, Kravchenko authorized sweeping searches at the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU). The next day, Zelensky signed a law that subordinated the NABU to the prosecutor general, a political appointee.

The bureau's independence was later restored following street protests and pressure from Brussels.

The crackdown on the NABU and SAPO was spearheaded by Yermak, according to Yurchyshyn, Zheleznyak, and two sources with direct knowledge of the situation.

Yurchyshyn argued that cases against Zelensky's inner circle "undermined Yermak's authority and weakened his position." Months later, they did just that.

Yermak's reach in domestic affairs is endless. Yet, what the all-powerful chief of staff truly enjoys is running the country's foreign policy, according to officials and diplomats who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Yermak became Ukraine's chief negotiator with Russia in 2019, after Zelensky was elected president and unsuccessfully attempted to bring the war with Russia to an end.

Yermak was in close contact with Dmitry Kozak, who was then Russia's chief negotiator and President Vladimir Putin's deputy chief of staff.

During the full-scale invasion, Yermak became Zelensky's go-to person for foreign policy. He constantly met foreign leaders and was in constant contact with ex-U.S. President Joe Biden's National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan.

"The influence of the President's Office on foreign policy is bigger than ever," Fesenko said, attributing this to an uptick in the Zelensky administration's foreign activity due to the war.

Fesenko argued that Yermak is focusing on foreign policy because "it's a key priority for Zelensky."

"What Zelensky likes is what defines Yermak's direction," he added.

Yermak gradually pushed aside the country's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, eventually replacing him in 2024 with Andriy Sybiha, who had been a deputy of Yermak.

Politico reported then, citing insiders, that Kuleba had irritated Yermak, who wanted more control over the Foreign Ministry.


Members of Trump's team do not want to talk to Yermak.
    

After Donald Trump was re-elected in 2024, Yermak's fortunes took a hit.

Members of Trump's team do not want to talk to Yermak, several sources told the Kyiv Independent. He is seen as partisan due to his ties to Sullivan, while his role isn't clearly defined.

Nonetheless, Zelensky continues to send him to spearhead international negotiations in Turkey, France, the U.K., and the U.S.

Politico reported in June, citing 10 people familiar with his interactions, that U.S. officials had "found Yermak to be uninformed about U.S. politics, abrasive and overly demanding with U.S. officials."

Yermak "struggled to secure meetings with senior Trump administration officials," and several meetings were canceled, according to Politico.

Yermak's desire to lead important talks and his misfortunes have become a joke in Kyiv, with the fact that Zelensky's chief of staff is the least desired negotiator for key Ukrainian allies being an open secret and a topic of conversation at nearly every political gathering.

"Yermak just really likes to travel, apparently," one senior European diplomat told the Kyiv Independent during an informal conversation.

It is believed, however, that Yermak is well aware of the situation. His response? Push out anyone who questions him, shows political potential, or brings bad news.

Several sources told the Kyiv Independent that Zelensky and Yermak do not tolerate people who are too ambitious and stand out.

One of the most notable examples was Valerii Zaluzhnyi, commander-in-chief of Ukraine's Armed Forces. He was fired in 2024 and appointed ambassador to the U.K., deemed to be an honorable exile from Kyiv.

Zaluzhnyi was sidelined after he became increasingly popular and was considered a potential competitor for Zelensky in a future presidential election.

Infrastructure Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Oleksandr Kubrakov was also fired in 2024. He was once seen as a top candidate for the prime minister's job.

Sources told the Kyiv Independent that Kubrakov was dismissed due to perceptions that he was overly ambitious, acted autonomously, and maintained direct contact with the U.S. embassy.

Among the officials that Yermak has allegedly been trying to push out is Deputy Prime Minister and Digital Transformation Minister Mykhailo Fedorov.

In 2024, drone purchases for the army were transferred from Fedorov's ministry to the Cabinet. Anti-corruption activists then accused Yermak of trying to sideline Fedorov in order to control drone purchases himself.

With few other voices left around Zelensky, Yermak has been running the show.

"The thinking in the president's head is shaped by a single person," Shabunin said. "And even if Zelensky were a governance genius, that would still be a disaster."

Harvard University has reopened an investigation into connections between former President Larry Summers and Jeffrey Epstein, a university spokesperson said Wednesday, and Summers' office said he would resign from the board of OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT.

Regarded as a leading voice on the U.S. economy, the former treasury secretary was also affiliated with multiple think tanks, research centers and media organizations. Several of them confirmed that those affiliations have ended.

Harvard did not mention Summers by name, but the decision to restart the probe follows the release of emails showing that he maintained a friendly relationship with Epstein long after the financier pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from an underage girl in 2008.

“The University is conducting a review of information concerning individuals at Harvard included in the newly released Jeffrey Epstein documents to evaluate what actions may be warranted,” spokesperson Jason Newton said in a statement first reported by The Boston Globe and The Harvard Crimson.

An earlier review completed in 2020 found that Epstein visited Harvard's campus more than 40 times after his 2008 sex-crimes conviction and was given his own office and unfettered access to a research center he helped establish. The professor who provided the office was later barred from starting new research or advising students for at least two years.

Summers said late Monday that he would step back from public commitments. His office said Wednesday that his plans include resigning from the board of directors of OpenAI.




“I am grateful for the opportunity to have served, excited about the potential of the company, and look forward to following their progress,” he said in a statement.

The OpenAI board said it appreciated Summers' contributions and perspective.

Summers joined the OpenAI board in November 2023 as part of an effort to restore stability at the nonprofit and bring back its CEO, Sam Altman, after previous board members fired Altman days earlier.

On Tuesday, Summers appeared before his class at Harvard, where he teaches “The Political Economy of Globalization” to undergraduates with Robert Lawrence, a professor with the Harvard Kennedy School.

“Some of you will have seen my statement of regret expressing my shame with respect to what I did in communication with Mr. Epstein and that I've said that I'm going to step back from public activities for a while. But I think it's very important to fulfill my teaching obligations,” he said.

Summers' remarks were captured on video by several students, but no one appeared to publicly respond to his comments.

Epstein, who authorities said died by suicide in 2019, was a convicted sex offender infamous for his connections to wealthy and powerful people, making him a fixture of outrage and conspiracy theories about wrongdoing among American elites.

Summers served as treasury secretary from 1999 to 2001 under President Bill Clinton. He was Harvard's president for five years from 2001 to 2006. When asked about the emails last week, Summers issued a statement saying he has “great regrets in my life” and that his association with Epstein was a “major error in judgement.”

Other organizations that confirmed the end of their affiliations with Summers included the Center for American Progress, the Center for Global Development and the Budget Lab at Yale University. Bloomberg TV said Summers' withdrawal from public commitments included his role as a paid contributor, and the New York Times said it will not renew his contract as a contributing opinion writer.

This story has been corrected to show that Summers' statement about stepping back from public commitments was issued late Monday, not Tuesday.

ALEXANDRIA, Virginia — Whether President Donald Trump dislikes James Comey is irrelevant to the question of dismissing the two-count indictment against the former FBI director, federal prosecutors argued in court Wednesday morning.

The hearing in Alexandria, Virginia, was the latest step in Comey's effort to throw out the charges on the grounds that the prosecution is a politically driven act of retaliation orchestrated by the president. Comey's attorneys argue he was targeted because he publicly criticized Trump and resisted political pressure during his tenure at the FBI. Prosecutors countered that Comey was charged “simply for lying to Congress,” not because the president harbors long-standing animus toward him.

Justice Department attorney Tyler Lemons told U.S. District Judge Michael Nachmanoff that the defense was making “inferential leaps” and had not shown evidence that Trump directed the case. “He was not indicted at the direction of the president of the United States,” Lemons said, adding that interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan, who obtained an indictment days after her appointment, “was not a puppet” of the president to pursue his political enemies.

Comey's attorney, Michael Dreeben, insisted the record demonstrates the opposite. 

“The president of the United States has caused the executive branch to prosecute a perceived enemy,” he said, pointing to Trump's September Truth Social post telling Attorney General Pam Bondi that “we can't delay any longer” over cases involving Comey, New York Attorney General Letitia James, and Sen. Adam Schiff (D-CA). Dreeben said Trump had already forced out the previous U.S. attorney, Erik Siebert, after Siebert resisted bringing politically charged cases and appointed Halligan, who had no prosecutorial experience, in his place.

“If that's not a direction to prosecute, I'm not really sure what is,” Dreeben told the court.

Defense filings assert that “objective evidence establishes that President Trump directed the prosecution of Mr. Comey in retaliation for Mr. Comey's public criticisms and to punish Mr. Comey because of personal spite.” They argue that the case would “likely not have been brought” but for “the intervention of the President himself.” 

Comey's team has compiled more than 200 of Trump's comments about the former FBI director, including the message calling on Bondi to act, which was reportedly intended to be private.

Prosecutors urged the court to reject the defense's narrative about how the indictment came together. In written arguments, they said Trump's posts merely reflect his belief that Comey committed crimes and that “personal dislike does not equate to legal prejudice.” They emphasized that the charges, one count of false statements and one count of obstruction, involve Comey's 2020 Senate testimony about whether he authorized leaks to the press.

“The Executive cannot be expected to ignore agency heads lying about official actions simply because they later become outspoken critics,” the DOJ wrote in court filings. Prosecutors also argued that Halligan's decisions reflected her own judgment and not Trump's, saying her presentation of the case to the grand jury “does not demonstrate animus.”

Nachmanoff pressed Lemons on one of the core factual disputes: whether career prosecutors in the office initially recommended against bringing the case. “Was there a declination memo?” the judge asked. Lemons initially said he did not “know the world of what documents exist,” prompting Nachmanoff to ask whether he had even sought to find out. Lemons later admitted that he looked into the matter but was bound by instructions from Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche's office not to disclose the answer.

“I am aware of various draft memos,” he told the court, but he said he could not say more.

Only later in the hearing did the dispute over the grand jury process surface. Halligan, Trump's handpicked interim U.S. attorney, acknowledged that the full grand jury did not see the final version of the indictment pending against Comey and that only the foreperson and one additional juror reviewed the altered charging document. Halligan said the full panel had previously reviewed an earlier version but conceded the revised indictment was taken directly to the magistrate's courtroom for signature.

Nachmanoff appeared troubled that the final indictment had not been presented to the full panel, asking both prosecutors whether the procedure complied with grand jury requirements. Comey's attorneys argued the concession means “there is no indictment,” noting that the statute of limitations has now expired.

Halligan's conduct is separately under scrutiny from Magistrate Judge William Fitzpatrick, who earlier this week wrote that Comey had made a “particularized and factually based showing” that irregularities may justify dismissing the indictment. Fitzpatrick cited “fundamental misstatements of the law” by Halligan and raised concerns that the indictment returned in open court was not the same document the grand jury deliberated upon. Nachmanoff delayed Fitzpatrick's order requiring the DOJ to hand over grand jury audio, saying he would hear objections from the government by Wednesday afternoon and a response from the defense by Friday.

JUDGE ORDERS DOJ TO TURN OVER GRAND JURY MATERIALS TO COMEY, CITING POSSIBLE ‘MISSTEPS'

The stakes for the selective and vindictive motions hearing extend beyond Comey. The indictment against the New York attorney general, also brought by Halligan, is now intertwined with a separate challenge to Halligan's legal authority. Judge Cameron McGowan Currie is weighing whether Halligan's appointment as interim U.S. attorney was lawful, a ruling she has said she will issue before Thanksgiving. James, who has pleaded not guilty to bank fraud and false statements charges concerning her residence in Norfolk, Virginia, is scheduled for her own selective and vindictive prosecution hearing the week after Thanksgiving.

Comey, who pleaded not guilty in October, is scheduled for trial on Jan. 5, 2026. Nachmanoff said he would not issue any ruling on Wednesday, telling the courtroom that “the issues are too wavy and too complex.”

Energy Secretary Chris Wright discusses President Donald Trump securing a trillion-dollar investment pledge from Saudi Arabia and reports of China expanding its nuclear test site on ‘America's Newsroom.'

President Donald Trump vowed that the U.S. would work on securing peace in Sudan thanks to the urging of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

Trump made the announcement while speaking to Saudi and U.S. officials at the Kennedy Center in Washington on Wednesday. The administration has been vocal about peace efforts in Sudan for months, but now Trump appears to be redoubling efforts.

"Working with the crown prince was amazing because he said, 'Sir, you're talking about a lot of wars, but there's a place on Earth called Sudan, and it's horrible what's happening,'" Trump said, saying MBS explained the cultural history behind the conflict.

"Really amazing to hear," Trump said, addressing the Saudi leader. "You know we've already started working on that, OK?

"We're working on that. We started about 30 minutes after you explained to us the great importance of that. I view it differently now than I did just a day ago."

Trump's efforts come after Pope Leo XIV also called attention to the persecution of Christians in Sudan and elsewhere on Tuesday.

"In various parts of the world, Christians suffer discrimination and persecution. I think especially of Bangladesh, Nigeria, Mozambique, Sudan, and other countries from which we frequently hear of attacks on communities and places of worship," the Pope wrote in a statement.

"Let us pray that all violence may cease and that believers may work together for the common good."

Talks to end the fighting between the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militia, led by Gen. Mohammad Hamdan Dagalo Musa, known as Hemedti, and the Khartoum government's Sudan Armed Forces (SAF), under the control of Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, began during the Biden administration but failed to make headway. They have since gained momentum under Trump, with the U.S. forming a so-called international Quad in September with Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

Earlier this month, U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres called for an immediate ceasefire in Sudan. Speaking on the sidelines of a conference in Qatar, Guterres said the war was "spiraling out of control."

"The fall of El-Fasher to the RSF is a defining moment in Sudan's brutal civil war", Mariam Wahba, research analyst at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD), told Fox News Digital. "It marks the militia's full control of the Darfur region and leaves Sudan effectively split in two."

The U.N. reports that "over 21 million people across Sudan are facing high levels of acute food insecurity — the largest such crisis in the world." The latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification found that famine is ongoing in the now-captured El-Fasher and in Kadugli, South Kordofan, with families trapped and surviving on leaves, animal feed and grass.

            • Bombshell about grand jury: Interim US Attorney Lindsey Halligan took the stand briefly Wednesday, saying only two grand jurors reviewed the final indictment it handed up against former FBI Director James Comey. Comey's attorney then argued Halligan's testimony indicates, “there is no indictment” against his client.
    


Should it be tossed? A federal judge in Alexandria, Virginia, heard former Comey's arguments for why his indictment should be dismissed. Comey's attorney, Michael Dreeben, argued the case was brought at the direction of President Donald Trump and based on his animosity toward Comey. Prosecutor Tyler Lemons said that Halligan was “not a puppet” and the case was based on Comey's alleged lie.
    


            • The case: Comey is accused of lying during a 2020 hearing about whether he ever authorized leaks to the press and has pleaded not guilty. The judge is weighing whether Trump's history of anti-Comey comments and a social media post asking Attorney General Pam Bondi for “justice” enough to show Comey was unfairly plucked for prosecution.
    


            Judge Michael Nachmanoff directed the Justice Department to respond in a filing by 5 p.m. ET tonight to the revelations that interim US Attorney Lindsey Halligan hadn't presented the charges James Comey now faces to the full grand jury for approval.
    


            Before ending the hearing around 11:30am ET, Judge Michael Nachmanoff said he would not make any ruling Wednesday on whether James Comey is being vindictively prosecuted after the revelation that a full grand jury never saw the final indictment handed up against Comey.
    


                    “The issues are too weighty and too complex.”
                


                    Judge Michael Nachmanoff
                


Correction: This post has been corrected to update a quote from Judge Michael Nachmanoff. Nachmanoff called the issues “too weighty.”



            The full grand jury never reviewed the indictment it handed up against former FBI Director James Comey, interim US Attorney Lindsey Halligan conceded Wednesday.
    


            In a shocking back and forth, prosecutors said that instead of presenting a new indictment to the grand jury after it declined to approve one of the counts, Halligan simply brought an altered version to the magistrate's courtroom for the grand jury's foreperson to sign.
    


            “The new indictment wasn't a new indictment,” prosecutor Tyler Lemons said, attempting to justify that it was only reviewed by the foreperson.
    


            Judge Michael Nachmanoff quickly called Halligan, who was the only prosecutor who presented the case to the grand jury, to the lectern, asking her to confirm that the entire grand jury was never presented the altered indictment.
    


            The judge started, “Am I correct -”
    


            “No, you're not,” Halligan interrupted. She said that there was one additional grand juror in the magistrate's courtroom and quoted her back-and-forth with that judge.
    


            “I'm familiar with the transcript,” Nachmanoff said. He then told her to sit down.
    


            Calling Lemons back to the stand, Nachmanoff asked: Am I correct that the new document was never presented to the grand jury for approval?
    


            Lemons carefully responded, “I wasn't there, but that is my understanding.”
    


            Comey's attorney Michael Dreeben then argued to the judge that, given the testimony of the prosecutor, “no indictment was returned.”
    


            “There is no indictment,” he said, adding that the statute of limitations has now elapsed against Comey on charges of lying to Congress.
    


            Justice Department lawyer Tyler Lemons argued former FBI Director James Comey was making “inferential leaps” in arguing the case is selective and vindictive.
    


            “There's been no proof that US Attorney Halligan took” Trump's social media post “as a charge,” Lemons said, referring to Lindsey Halligan, who President Donald Trump to be interim US Attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia. Halligan presented the case to the grand jury, which handed up the indictment.
    


            “Ms. Halligan was not a puppet,” he added.
    


            The judge then questioned “what independent examination could she have made” in the few days between her appointment and the charges being brought against Comey.
    


            Lawyers for New York Attorney General Letitia James and federal prosecutors in Albany, New York, will square off next month.
    


            A federal judge set a hearing for December 4 for James to challenge the appointment of John Sarcone, the US attorney for the Northern District of New York, to try to get a subpoena he signed quashed.
    


            Sarcone is leading the criminal investigation into the attorney general's handling of two cases and whether anyone's constitutional rights were violated. He signed a subpoena in August seeking information related to James' case alleging President Donald Trump and the Trump Organization inflated the value of properties to get better interest rates on loans. A second subpoena relates to a civil investigation into the National Rifle Association.
    


            James is arguing the subpoenas should be quashed because they are retaliatory, infringe on state's rights and are overly broad.
    


            The Justice Department said in court filings that a grand jury can issue subpoenas regardless of who is US attorney but they defended Sarcone's appointment as legally valid.
    


            Sarcone is the latest US attorney whose appointment has been challenged. In three other cases courts have found the Justice Department appointments have been unlawful.
    


            Justice Department lawyer Tyler Lemons declined to say whether prosecutors have submitted a memo recommending that former FBI Director James Comey should not be prosecuted. Lemons told the judge that someone in Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche's office told him he couldn't disclose “privileged” information without their permission.
    


            “At this point, my position would be, whether there was a declination memo, is privileged,” Lemons said, adding that “I don't know in the world of documents there is a declination memo.”
    


            Judge Michael Nachmanoff challenged the assertion, pushing Lemons to say that, “someone in the Deputy Attorney General's office” had instructed him not to say anything.
    


            “What did someone in the Deputy Attorney General's office instruct you not to say,” Nachmanoff asked.
    


            Lemons conceded that he has “reviewed” draft memorandums, but declined to give additional details.
    


            “I hope you understand that I am trying to answer your questions,” Lemons said.
    


            Prosecutor Tyler Lemons began his argument Wednesday by arguing that former FBI Director James Comey was charged simply for lying to Congress.
    


            “He was not indicted at the direction of the president of the United States,” Lemons said.
    


            Lemons also said that a grand jury properly handed up the indictment.
    


            “We'll have some questions about that,” Judge Michael Nachmanoff said.
    


            A magistrate judge has raised many potential issues with how the case was presented to the grand jury and Comey's attorneys are seeking all transcripts in the proceedings.
    


            James Comey's attorney Micheal Dreeben argued the ongoing controversy over the so called “Epstein files” shows that President Donald Trump is continuing to direct operations of the Justice Department.
    


            Trump, Dreeben said, directed Bondi to open a new investigation into high-profile Democrats linked to Jeffrey Epstein, despite a Justice Department memo from earlier this year saying there was no basis for additional prosecutions based on the evidence it had.
    


            Bondi's response: “Thank you, Mr. President.”



            Judge Michael Nachmanoff raised other comments Trump had made after his social media post directed at Attorney General Pam Bondi. In those comments, Trump told reporters that his post was not directing Bondi.
    


            “I just want people to act,” the president said, according to the judge, who read Trump's comments in the court.
    


            “It doesn't walk back anything he said to the US Attorney General,” Dreeben replied.
    


            The comments after the social media post were “made for the press, not the Attorney General,” Dreeben said.
    


            Dreeben compared the social media post to the famous line from King Henry II: “Who will rid me of this meddlesome priest?”
    


            “Henry the Second can't be binding precedent in this court,” the judge joked to laughter in the courtroom.
    


            James Comey's attorney argued Wednesday that President Donald Trump's September social media post pushing the Justice Department to prosecute is a “crystal clear” example of why his client is being charged only because of the president's personal animosity.
    


            The post, Michael Dreeben, said, linked Comey to two other “enemies” of Trump, and portrayed his frustration that interim US Attorney Lindsey Halligan's predecessor was resisting bringing charges. Dreeben was referring to Sen. Adam Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James.
    


            “The President is underscoring what he wants here, [Erik] Siebert was not doing his job here.” The job of Siebert, who Trump replaced with Halligan, was to “prosecute,” Dreeben said.
    


            “If that's not a direction to prosecute, I'm not really sure what is,” Dreeben said.
    


            In his first question of the day, Judge Michael Nachmanoff asked James Comey's attorney Michael Dreeben if he was arguing the case was brought to punish the former FBI director for using his free speech rights or that Trump was targeting Comey because of his personal animosity toward against him.
    


            Dreeben told the judge it is both.
    


            “The President's hate or animosity or dislike of Mr. Comey” may be enough to initially fire Comey, Dreeben said, but not use the “full weight” of the criminal justice system against Comey.”
    


            Former FBI Director James Comey is in court as a hearing on whether the indictment against him should be tossed kicked off.
    


            Comey's attorney, Michael Dreeban, is arguing first.
    


            “The president of the United States has caused the executive branch to prosecute a perceived enemy,” Dreeban began his arguments Wednesday.
    


            Dreeban argued Trump has gone after the former director to “punish Mr. Comey for speaking out against him.”
    


            Comey points to a Truth Social post by President Donald Trump from September as an example of why the case against him is unfairly brought.
    


            “Pam: I have reviewed over 30 statements and posts saying that, essentially, ‘same old story as last time, all talk, no action. Nothing is being done. What about Comey, Adam ‘Shifty' Schiff, Leticia??? They're all guilty as hell, but nothing is going to be done,'” Trump wrote, referring to Comey, Sen. Adam Schiff of California, and New York Attorney General Letitia James.
    


             The Justice Department has argued in court documents that in that post, and others referring to Comey, Trump was just stating his belief that the former FBI director had broken the law. They also argue that Comey wouldn't be silenced by this prosecution and that it chose on its own accord to bring the case — just as it has prosecuted others for lying to Congress in the past.
    


            “The President does not harbor vindictive animus against the defendant in the relevant sense,” prosecutors wrote.
    


            Trump's social media posts “reflect the President's view that the defendant has committed crimes that should be met with prosecution. They may even suggest that the President disfavors the defendant,” the Justice Department also wrote. “But they are not direct evidence of a vindictive motive.”
    


            Just look at all the social media posts, James Comey's legal team will be arguing to a federal judge on Wednesday.
    


            The goal of the arguments will be to convince Judge Michael Nachmanoff of the Eastern District of Virginia that the Justice Department's decision to charge Comey was an abuse of power, coming at the direction of an angry and vindictive president – one who has long wanted Comey to face legal consequences and be silenced on the public stage.
    


            To make the argument, called a vindictive and selective prosecution motion, Comey's team has already submitted to the judge more than 60 pages of public statements of Comey and Trump sniping at one another over years. The majority of the social media posts are from Trump, and include his recent direction to Attorney General Pam Bondi to prosecute Comey and others in September.
    


            They also note the unusual circumstances of interim US Attorney Lindsey Halligan taking the indictment through the grand jury herself, just days after she was appointed and less than a week before the Department ran out of time to charge the Comey case.
    


            Motions like these are notoriously hard for defendants to win, though they are gaining some steam in court during this Trump administration, as top Justice officials make politically charged statements publicly about defendants under indictment.
    


            If Nachmanoff doesn't fully agree with Comey's team's argument on Wednesday, it's possible the judge could tell the Justice Department it needs to hand over more internal records and potentially even pursue sworn statements by top administration officials, like Attorney General Pam Bondi or even Trump himself. That would likely bring about new rounds of court fights over access and confidentiality. 



            The arguments, however, also may highlight how entrenched Trump is in what some consider his retaliatory presidency.
    


            The Justice Department's prosecution of former FBI Director James Comey could run into a buzzsaw before trial with more than one route for the possible disintegration of the case.
    


            Wednesday's arguments will focus on Donald Trump's years of publicizing his hatred for how Comey led the FBI and oversaw the Trump and Clinton investigations in 2016 and 2017. Comey's team says that makes the case unfair enough that it should be dismissed.
    


            But other issues the defense is leaning into revolve around how the FBI and Justice Department prosecutors handled its investigation of Comey, including whether evidence used to bring charges this year was tainted and whether Interim US Attorney Lindsey Halligan appropriately prosecuted the case.
    


            Comey's team is trying to get the case trimmed or thrown out the case entirely by arguing:
    


            • The evidence was unfairly used – either it was too old, hadn't been authorized by a court to be accessed by investigators, or wasn't properly reviewed by the government to filter out Comey's communications with his attorney.
    


            • Halligan abused the grand jury process, including by advising the grand jurors on the law incorrectly, regarding how a trial against Comey would work.
    


            • The question asked by Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz in the 2020 Senate hearing where Comey allegedly lied was far too ambiguous to base a case around.
    


            Separately, South Carolina-based federal Judge Cameron Currie is set to rule by next week on whether Halligan, serving as an interim US attorney, had the authority to prosecute Comey and another Trump political foe, New York Attorney General Letitia James, without being Senate confirmed.
    


            Will Judge Michael Nachmanoff bring up what interim US Attorney Lindsey Halligan said to the grand jury – an approach so questionable it could prompt the case against James Comey to be dismissed?
    


            He could.
    


            Earlier this week, a magistrate judge's opinion revealed multiple issues with Halligan's work so far.
    


            Nachmanoff is now set to review, as soon as this weekend, whether Comey's team will be entitled to the full grand jury record.
    


            The judge is also likely following the discussion in the court record so far describing what appears to be significant prosecutorial missteps.
    


            Those include, as described this week by the magistrate judge assisting Nachmanoff on the case:
    


            • Pushing forward a case where the evidence may not have been handled appropriately nor was authorized to be used.
    


            • Suggesting to the grand jury it could approve the Comey indictment while misleading the grand jurors on the law. Halligan implied Comey would need to testify to win his case at trial and the Justice Department may bring in better, additional evidence later, according to the magistrate judge's summary.
    


            • The possibility that several minutes of a prosecutor's discussion with the grand jury went unrecorded by a court transcriptionist.
    


            It's unclear how much discussion of Halligan with arise at the hearing. Comey's defense team has focused its written arguments on the years of encouragement by Donald Trump for the Justice Department to charge Comey.
    


            Halligan's part of that alleged scheme, they argue, was to secure an indictment that other prosecutors wouldn't greenlight.
    


            Michael Nachmanoff, the federal judge overseeing the criminal case against former FBI Director James Comey, has throughout his career as an attorney and judge earned a reputation in Virginia's legal community as a thoughtful, fair arbiter.
    


            Legal sources who have won and lost cases before Nachmanoff have described the 57-year-old judge as someone who keeps his personal views well-guarded and as unlikely to further inflame the atmosphere around Comey's prosecution.
    


            Nachmanoff, a fourth-degree Karate black belt and Washington, DC, native, worked for over a decade in the Office of the Federal Public Defender for the Eastern District of Virginia before becoming a federal judge in the same district years later.
    


            As a public defender, Nachmanoff argued before the Supreme Court in 2007, winning the case that gave federal judges the discretion to issue “reasonably” shorter prison sentences for crack-cocaine crimes.

RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — Federal agents have now arrested more than 250 people during a North Carolina immigration crackdown centered around Charlotte, the state's largest city, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said Wednesday.

The operation that began over the weekend is the latest phase of Republican President Donald Trump's aggressive mass deportation efforts that have sent the military and immigration agents into Democratic-run cities — from Chicago to Los Angeles. 

Immigration officials have blanketed the country since January, pushing detention counts to all-time highs above 60,000. Big cities and small towns across the country are targeted daily amid higher-profile pushes in places such as Portland, Oregon, where more than 560 immigration arrests were made in October. Smaller bursts of enforcement have popped up elsewhere.

The push to carry out arrests in North Carolina expanded to areas around the state capital of Raleigh on Tuesday, spreading fear in at least one immigrant-heavy suburb.

Federal agents in North Carolina are expanding their immigration crackdown. AP correspondent Donna Warder reports.

The number of arrests around Charlotte and beyond during what the government has dubbed “ Operation Charlotte's Web ” was about double the total announced by DHS officials earlier this week. The department said in a statement that agencies “continue to target some of the most dangerous criminal illegal aliens.”

Their targets include people living in the U.S. without legal permission and those who allegedly have criminal records.

Federal officials have offered few details about those arrested. They've also remained quiet about the scope of the enforcement operations across North Carolina and where agents will show up next, keeping communities on edge.




The crackdown in Charlotte has been met with pockets of resistance and protests.

About 100 people gathered outside a Home Depot store in Charlotte on Wednesday, where federal agents have been spotted multiple times since the surge started. Protest organizers briefly went inside the store with orange and white signs that read, “ICE out of Home Depot, Protect our communities.”

Arrests in Charlotte have created a chilling effect in immigrant neighborhoods — school attendance dropped, and small shops and restaurants closed to avoid confrontations between customers and federal agents.

Customers at a laundromat left behind their clothes in washers and dryers and haven't returned after agents showed up at a shopping center on Sunday, said David Rebolloso, who owns the business.

Agents didn't target his laundromat, but it still impacted his bottom line and shut down the neighboring shops, said Rebolloso, a Mexican-American born in Brownsville, Texas. 

“We're only open because I'm an American citizen, so it doesn't bother me,” he said. “But of course, business is down. I have no customers.”

Just days after beginning the crackdown in North Carolina, Border Patrol agents were expected to arrive in New Orleans by the end of the week to start preparing for their next big operation in southeast Louisiana, according to documents obtained by The Associated Press and three people familiar with the operation.

Around 250 federal border agents are set to descend on New Orleans in the coming weeks for a two-month immigration crackdown expected to begin in earnest on Dec. 1.

Gregory Bovino, the Border Patrol commander tapped to head the Louisiana sweep, has been on the ground in North Carolina this week, leading the operation there as well. Bovino has become the Trump administration's leader of the large-scale crackdowns and has drawn criticism over the tactics used to carry out arrests. 

DHS has declined to comment on the operation. “For the safety and security of law enforcement, we're not going to telegraph potential operations,” spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said.

A startling online trend is making a resurgence among teenagers who could face deadly consequences as they terrorize homeowners in a viral prank, police around the country warn.

Home surveillance footage shows a group of masked California youngsters partaking in the "Door Kick Challenge," where pranksters run up to a stranger's home and kick the front door as hard as they can before rushing away, according to the Elk Grove Police Department. 

The community of Elk Grove – located roughly 15 miles from Sacramento – has seen at least eight reported incidents and five arrests over the past month, CBS News Sacramento reported. 

Last week, two 13-year-olds were arrested after allegedly causing more than $680 in damage to a homeowner's front door, according to authorities. Additionally, three juveniles were taken into custody earlier this month for their alleged involvement in the prank.

Another incident left a homeowner with $900 worth of damage to their doorframe, the outlet reported. Any crime exceeding $950 in damages could reportedly result in felony charges, with parents on the hook for paying the cost of their child's actions. 

"Somebody could come out with a gun, and you could never know, these kids could be dead just for a stupid prank," Ronnie Monroe told CBS13. 

Monroe reportedly had his garage door kicked in by pranksters in two separate incidents in September, with both pranks taking place in the early morning hours.

"You can't catch them if you can't see them," Monroe told the outlet. "They get on electric bikes, and they are gone." 

The Elk Grove Police Department did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. 

The trend has been popping up in various cities around the country as it regains traction among teens. 

On July 22, a Florida teenager was caught on camera kicking the front door of a Belleville home, FOX35 reported. The incident resulted in roughly $500 worth of damage to the homeowner's doorframe, which was reportedly split down the middle.

One week earlier, homeowner Kevin Jasper reported being targeted by a lone teenager partaking in the prank, according to FOX35. 

"We heard a big bang on the front door," Jasper told the outlet. "We didn't know what it was. We were like, ‘What the heck is going on, is somebody trying to break in?'"

Additionally, two teenagers in Volusia County were arrested and charged with felonies after they were caught on camera kicking a neighbor's door. 

Another incident earlier this year involved five juveniles allegedly kicking the front door of a Florida home before firing an Airsoft gun and fleeing the area, according to the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office.

While teens may believe the prank is harmless, authorities are warning their actions come with grave risks. 

"Imagine being in your home at 2 in the morning, and you are getting these kicking sounds," Volusia County Sheriff Mike Chitwood told FOX35. "And in Florida, under the ‘stand your ground' [law] you are coming out with your gun. Somebody is going to get killed – this isn't funny."

Fox News senior correspondent Jonathan Serrie explains the importance of Blue Origin's New Glenn launch for the next expedition to Mars on 'The Will Cain Show.'

The estranged wife of a NASA astronaut pleaded guilty to lying to law enforcement over what was alleged to be the first crime to be committed in space. 

Summer Worden now faces up to five years in federal prison and a possible $250,000 maximum fine in relation to the false reports she made about Anne McClain, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Texas. 

"In July 2019, Summer Heather Worden alleged her estranged spouse had guessed the password and illegally accessed her bank account while the spouse was deployed to the International Space Station," the office said. 

"However, Worden had actually opened the account in April 2018. Both parties had accessed it until January 2019 when Worden changed the credentials," it added. "The investigation revealed Worden had granted her spouse access to her bank records from at least 2015, including her login credentials."

The initial claim made by Worden – which was the first allegation of a crime in space – generated inquiries from the Federal Trade Commission and NASA's Inspector General, the New York Times reported.

NSI Deputy Executive Director Martha Miller joins ‘Fox News Live' to discuss the State Department's warning to foreigners not to glorify the assassination of political activist Charlie Kirk.

FIRST ON FOX: Hundreds of State Department employees will receive restitution after an internal review under Secretary Marco Rubio found they were denied promotions during the Biden administration for not meeting new diversity, equity and inclusion standards.

In addition to removing the diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility (DEIA) precept from the State Department's promotion process, officials said roughly 295 employees who were marked down for not showing they would "seek diversity in staff" will now receive pay increases, administrative promotions and letters of commendation.

"The Trump administration is providing restitution to State Department employees who were adversely impacted by the previous administration's ideological agenda," a State Department official said.

The department conducted an internal review of 7,319 employees who competed for promotion in 2024. Those employees were judged on five precepts: communication, leadership, management, knowledge and DEIA. Under President Donald Trump, the DEIA precept was replaced with a new criterion: "fidelity," Fox News Digital previously reported.

Promotion board members were instructed to low-rank employees who exhibited a "lack of sensitivity to the importance of diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA)," according to a State Department official.

The DEIA promotion precept was damaging to those who displayed "little indication of seeking diversity in staff," the official claimed.

"The Biden administration imposed ideological litmus tests on civil servants, penalizing competent and deserving government employees in the process," principal deputy spokesperson Tommy Pigott said.

"Under President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the State Department rewards excellence, which is the right thing to do for our workforce, for our country, and for the American people."

The Trump administration's restitution plan marks a broader rollback of DEI-based policies across federal agencies, part of Trump's pledge to restore merit-based advancement in government service.

The State Department's previous hiring guide for 2022–2025 required foreign service employees to "demonstrate impact in diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility," according to the internal documents.

Entry-level applicants were expected to proactively seek to "improve one's own self-awareness with respect to promoting inclusivity." Mid- and senior-level supervisors were told to recruit and retain diverse teams, respond immediately to noninclusive workplace behaviors and "consult with impacted staff before finalizing decisions.

On his first day in office in 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order directing federal agencies to pursue policies that advance "equity." 

"Affirmatively advancing equity, civil rights, racial justice, and equal opportunity is the responsibility of the whole of our Government," he stated. 

"It is therefore the policy of my Administration that the Federal Government should pursue a comprehensive approach to advancing equity for all, including people of color and others who have been historically underserved, marginalized, and adversely affected by persistent poverty and inequality." 

Fox News Digital reached out to Biden's office for comment and has not yet received a reply.

As President Donald Trump laid it out to reporters this summer, the plan was simple. 

Republicans, the president said, were “entitled” to five more conservative-leaning U.S. House seats in Texas and additional ones in other red states. The president broke with more than a century of political tradition in directing the GOP to redraw those maps in the middle of the decade to avoid losing control of Congress in next year's midterms.

Four months later, Trump's audacious ask looks anything but simple. After a federal court panel struck down Republicans' new map in Texas on Tuesday, the entire exercise holds the potential to net Democrats more winnable seats in the House instead.

“Trump may have let the genie out of the bottle,” said UCLA law professor Rick Hasen, “but he may not get the wish he'd hoped for.”

Trump's plan is to bolster his party's narrow House margin to protect Republicans from losing control of the chamber in next year's elections. Normally, the president's party loses seats in the midterms. But his involvement in redistricting is instead becoming an illustration of the limits of presidential power.

To hold Republicans' grip on power in Washington, Trump is relying on a complex political process.

Redrawing maps is a decentralized effort that involves navigating a tangle of legal rules. It also involves a tricky political calculus because the legislators who hold the power to draw maps often want to protect themselves, business interests or local communities more than ruthlessly help their party.




And when one party moves aggressively to draw lines to help itself win elections — also known as gerrymandering — it runs the risk of pushing its rival party to do the same.

That's what Trump ended up doing, spurring California voters to replace their map drawn by a nonpartisan commission with one drawn by Democrats to gain five seats. If successful, the move would cancel out the action taken by Texas Republicans. California voters approved that map earlier this month, and if a Republican lawsuit fails to block it, that map giving Democrats more winnable seats will remain in effect even if Texas' remains stalled.

“Donald Trump and Greg Abbott played with fire, got burned -- and democracy won,” California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, posted on X after the Texas ruling, mentioning his Republican counterpart in Texas along with the president.

Rep. Kevin Kiley, a Republican whose northern California district would be redrawn under the state's new map, agreed.

“It could very well come out as a net loss for Republicans, honestly when you look at the map, or at the very least, it could end up being a wash,” Kiley said. “But it's something that never should have happened. It was ill-conceived from the start.”

There's no guarantee that Tuesday's ruling on the Texas map will stand. Many lower courts have blocked Trump's initiatives, only for the conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court to put those rulings on hold. Texas Republicans immediately appealed Tuesday's decision to the high court, too.

Republicans hope the nation's highest court also weakens or eliminates the last major component of the Voting Rights Act next year, which could open the door to further redraws in their favor.

Even before Tuesday, Trump's push for mid-decade redistricting was not playing out as neatly as he had hoped, though he had scored some apparent wins. North Carolina Republicans potentially created another conservative-leaning seat in that battleground state, while Missouri Republicans redrew their congressional map at Trump's urging to eliminate one Democratic seat. The Missouri plan faces lawsuits and a possible referendum that would force a statewide vote on the matter.

Trump's push has faltered elsewhere. Republicans in Kansas balked at trying to eliminate the state's lone swing seat, held by a Democratic congresswoman. Indiana Republicans also refused to redraw their map to eliminate their two Democratic-leaning congressional seats.

After Trump attacked the main Indiana holdout, state Sen. Greg Goode, on social media, he was the victim of a swatting call over the weekend that led to sheriff's deputies coming to his house.

The bulk of redistricting normally happens once every 10 years, following the release of new population estimates from the U.S. Census. That requires state lawmakers to adjust their legislative lines to make sure every district has roughly the same population. It also opens the door to gerrymandering maps to make it harder for the party out of power to win legislative seats.

Inevitably, redistricting leads to litigation, which can drag on for years and spur mid-decade, court-mandated revisions.

Republicans stood to benefit from these after the last cycle in 2021 because they won state supreme court elections in North Carolina and Ohio in 2022. But some litigation hasn't gone the GOP's way. A judge in Utah earlier this month required the state to make one of its four congressional seats Democratic-leaning.

Trump broke with modern political practice by urging a wholesale, mid-decade redraw in red states.

Democrats were in a bad position to respond to Trump's gambit because more states they control have lines drawn by independent commissions rather than by partisan lawmakers, the legacy of government reform efforts.

But with Newsom's push to let Democrats draw California's lines successful, the party is looking to replicate it elsewhere.

Next up may be Virginia, where Democrats recaptured the governor's office this month and expanded their margins in the Legislature. A Democratic candidate for governor in Colorado has called for a similar measure there. Republicans currently hold 9 of the 19 House seats in those two states.

Overall, Republicans have more to lose if redistricting becomes a purely partisan activity nationally and voters in blue states ditch their nonpartisan commissions to let their preferred party maximize its margins. In the last complete redistricting cycle in 2021, commissions drew 95 House seats that Democrats would have otherwise drawn, and only 13 that Republicans would have drawn.

On Tuesday, Republicans were reappraising Trump's championing of redistricting hardball.

“I think if you look at the basis of this, there was no member of the delegation that was asked our opinion,” Republican Rep. Pete Sessions of Texas told reporters.

Incumbents usually don't like the idea of radically redrawing districts. It can lead to what political experts call a “dummymander” — spreading the opposing party's voters so broadly that they end up endangering your own incumbents in a year, like 2026, that is expected to be bad for the party in power.

Incumbents also don't like losing voters who have supported them or getting wholly new communities drawn into their districts, said Jonathan Cervas, who teaches redistricting at Carnegie Mellon University and has drawn new maps for courts. Democratic lawmakers in Illinois and Maryland have so far resisted mid-decade redraws to pad their majorities in their states, joining their GOP counterparts in Indiana and Kansas.

Cervas said that's why it was striking to watch Trump push Republicans to dive into mid-decade redistricting.

“The idea they'd go along to get along is basically crazy,” he said.

Harvard University has reopened an investigation into connections between former President Larry Summers and Jeffrey Epstein, a university spokesperson said Wednesday, and Summers' office said he would resign from the board of OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT.

Regarded as a leading voice on the U.S. economy, Summers was also affiliated with multiple think tanks, research centers and media organizations. Several of them confirmed that those affiliations have ended.

Harvard did not mention Summers by name, but the decision to restart the probe follows the release of emails showing that Summers, a former treasury secretary, maintained a friendly relationship with Epstein long after the financier pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from an underage girl in 2008.

“The University is conducting a review of information concerning individuals at Harvard included in the newly released Jeffrey Epstein documents to evaluate what actions may be warranted,” spokesperson Jason Newton said in a statement first reported by The Boston Globe and The Harvard Crimson.

An earlier review completed in 2020 found that Epstein visited Harvard's campus more than 40 times after his 2008 sex-crimes conviction and was given his own office and unfettered access to a research center he helped establish. The professor who provided the office was later barred from starting new research or advising students for at least two years.

Summers said late Monday that he would step back from public commitments. His office said Wednesday that includes resigning from the board of directors of OpenAI.




“I am grateful for the opportunity to have served, excited about the potential of the company, and look forward to following their progress,” he said in a statement.

The OpenAI board said it appreciated Summers' contributions and perspective.

Summers joined the OpenAI board in November 2023, part of an effort to restore stability at the nonprofit and bring back its CEO, Sam Altman, after previous board members fired Altman days earlier.

On Tuesday, Summers appeared before his economics class and addressed his involvement with Epstein.

“Some of you will have seen my statement of regret expressing my shame with respect to what I did in communication with Mr. Epstein and that I've said that I'm going to step back from public activities for a while. But I think it's very important to fulfill my teaching obligations,” he said.

Summers' remarks were captured on video by Harvard student Rosie Couture, who shared the video online.

Epstein, who authorities said died by suicide in 2019, was a convicted sex offender infamous for his connections to wealthy and powerful people, making him a fixture of outrage and conspiracy theories about wrongdoing among American elites.

Summers served as treasury secretary from 1999 to 2001 under President Bill Clinton. He was Harvard's president for five years from 2001 to 2006. When asked about the emails last week, Summers issued a statement saying he has “great regrets in my life” and that his association with Epstein was a “major error in judgement.”

Other organizations that confirmed the end of their affiliations with Summers included the Center for American Progress, the Center for Global Development and the Budget Lab at Yale University. Bloomberg TV said Summers' withdrawal from public commitments included his role as a paid contributor, and the New York Times said it will not renew his contract as a contributing opinion writer.

This story has been corrected to show that Summers' statement about stepping back from public commitments was issued late Monday, not Tuesday.

FRANCONIA, N.H. (AP) — The closing of a health center in rural New Hampshire has raised concerns that the projected cuts in Medicaid are already taking a toll.

Last month, a site of the Ammonoosuc Community Health Services in Franconia, a town of around 1,000 people, closed for good.

Ammonoosuc officials and a Democratic senator have blamed Medicaid cuts for the closure of the facility that served 1,400 patients from Franconia, Easton, Lincoln and Sugar Hill. These are all tiny communities around the White Mountains, whose patients typically are older and sicker than in other parts of the state.

The closure of the Franconia center reflects the financial struggles facing community health centers and rural health care systems more broadly amid Medicaid cuts and a feared spike in health insurance rates. The government shutdown, which ended last week, was driven by a Democratic demand to extend tax credits, which ensure low- and middle-income people can afford health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, or ACA.

More than 100 hospitals closed over the past decade, according to the Center For Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform, a policy and advocacy group, and more than 700 more hospitals are at risk of closure. A branch of the HealthFirst Family Care Center, a facility in Canaan, New Hampshire also announced it was closing at the end of October due in part to “changes in Medicaid reimbursement and federal funding” for these facilities.

On average, the federally-funded community health centers like the one in Franconia are losing money, relying heavily on cash reserves, making service changes and sometimes closing locations to stay afloat, NACHC found. Nearly half have less than 90 days' cash on hand, according to the association. And the future is even more bleak with at least 2 million community health center patients expected to lose Medicaid coverage by 2034 and 2 million more who are newly uninsured turning to the centers for care.




Ed Shanshala, the CEO of Ammonoosuc, said the Medicaid cuts are to blame for the closure of the Franconia center. 

Shanshala runs a network of five health centers in New Hampshire which relies more than $2 million in federal funding — out of a $12 million budget. He faced a $500,000 shortfall due to the cuts and realized closing Franconia would save about half that money. It also was the only facility where they leased space.

“We're really left with no choice,” Shanshala said, adding the closure would save $250,000. Finding additional cuts is hard, given that the centers provide services to anyone under 200% of federal poverty levels, he said. And if he cuts additional services, Shanshala fears some patients will end up in a hospital emergency room or “stop engaging in health care period.”

Susan Bushby, a 70-year-old housekeeper, talked about how much she loved the staff and feared going to a new health center. She wouldn't know her way around a larger facility and wouldn't have the same rapport with the people there.

“I was very disturbed. I was down right angry,” said Bushby, who was brought to tears as she discussed the challenges of starting over at a new health center. “I just really like it there. I don't know, I'm just really going to miss it. It's really hard for me to explain, but it's going to be sad.”

Marsha Luce, whose family moved from Washington, D.C. area, in 2000, is especially concerned about the impact on her 72-year-old husband, a former volunteer firefighter who has a left ear and part of his jaw removed due to cancer. He also has heart and memory issues.

She worries about longer waits to see his doctor and the loss of relationships built up over decades in Franconia.

“It's going to be hard,” she said. “But it's a relationship that's going to be missed. It's a relationship that you can talk to people and you tell them something and you go, yeah, well, I've had cancer. Oh, let's see. Oh, yeah. There it is in your chart. Do you know what I mean?”

Every so often, a Republican with an axe to grind decides the most effective way to gain attention is to turn on President Donald Trump.

Today's Exhibit A is Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), who, over the past few weeks, has been ubiquitous on left-leaning TV and podcasts, primarily to attack Trump regarding the Epstein files. Once among the most mocked lawmakers regardless of party, she is now gaining fake respect from everywhere, including anti-Trump entities and television programs such as The View, CNN, and MSNBC. 

Headlines this week read:

CNN: “What Marjorie Taylor Greene's political revolt may say about Trump”

Politico: “Trump stews and Dems gloat over feud with Marjorie Taylor Greene”

Associated Press: MAGA rift grows as Trump feuds with Greene before key 2026 midterm elections

Newsweek: The evolution of Marjorie Taylor Greene

Legacy media are eating this grift up, after a week since the true political civil war broke out among Democrats, who were hoping to keep the government closed in perpetuity to resist Trump and rile up its growing left-wing base.

The said rift began after Trump rightly pointed out to Greene that her chances of winning a possible Senate race against Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-GA) were slim to none, with polls showing her losing by double digits in a state Trump won twice. Greene, once a staunch supporter of Trump, has since publicly revolted in a very personal manner, even going so far as to accuse the president of “protecting pedophiles” as it relates to Epstein.

“It is a shame our government is working harder to protect pedophiles than they are fighting for the victims,” Greene recently wrote on X.

This, of course, is a ridiculous claim from a ridiculous person. Examples are endless to support this perspective, including her endorsing a claim that wildfires in California were once started by “Jewish space lasers” led by Jewish elites in an effort to clear enough land for Gov. Gavin Newsom's (D-CA) high-speed rail project.

She has also accused 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton of mutilating a child in a satanic ritual — no, really.

This lawmaker also believes a plane never hit the Pentagon on 9/11, has implied the United States was behind the attacks, claimed that Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg died and was replaced by a body double, insisted the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting was a “false flag” to push gun control, while also actually saying the government has the ability to steer storms to affect voting in red states such as Florida.

“Yes they can control the weather,” she wrote on X in 2023. “It's ridiculous for anyone to lie and say it can't be done.”

Who is “they” exactly?

“Well some of them are listed on NOAA, as well as most of the ways weather can be modified,” she wrote while supplying zero evidence. “If your home or business or property is damaged or a loved one is killed by their weather modifications shouldn't you be eligible for compensation?”

There are no words. This person has no business working as a golf starter, let alone representing a district in Congress.

But during this anti-Trump media tour, none of the examples above are being broached in an effort to normalize her. Instead, the focus is on the president and Jeffrey Epstein, which the media hope will take down Trump. And they're even allowing MTG to claim that Israel is somehow involved in covering up the Epstein files.

“We saw Jeffrey Epstein with ties to [former Israeli Prime Minister] Ehud Barak,” she told CNN's Dana Bash. “We saw him making business deals with them, also business deals that involved the Israeli government, and seems to have led into their intel agencies. And I think the right question to ask is, was Jeffrey Epstein working for Israel?”

And what is her evidence to support this? We don't know, because Bash just moved on without following up.

As for Trump, he had enough of all of this over the weekend.

“She has told many people that she is upset that I don't return her phone calls anymore, but with 219 Congressmen/women, 53 U.S. Senators, 24 Cabinet Members, almost 200 Countries, and an otherwise normal life to lead, I can't take a ranting lunatic's call every day,” he wrote on Truth Social.

“I understand that wonderful, conservative people are thinking about primarying Marjorie in her District of Georgia, that they too are fed up with her and her antics and, if the right person runs, they will have my complete and unyielding Support,” he added. “She has gone far left, even doing ‘The View,' with their Low IQ Republican hating Anchors. Thank you for your attention to this matter. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”

“President Trump just attacked me and lied about me,” Greene responded on X. “The hoax pizza deliveries have started now, to my house and my family members. Update: We also received a pipe bomb threat on my construction company's office building.”

Yep. Greene goes after Trump for weeks on television and on social media, and the moment he responds, she does what she does best: plays the victim.

In the end, Greene will continue to be the next shiny object for legacy media to attempt to prop up. She will ride this wave to an announcement in 2027 saying she's running for president while claiming to be more MAGA than Trump himself, who literally launched the movement. MAGA without Trump is like The Sopranos with Tony Soprano — it doesn't exist.

Greene will take the Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA) lane on the Republican side during the presidential primary season. What's the Swalwell lane? That's a place where an unserious candidate receives tons of airtime after saying provocative things about their opponents while polling with 1% support. As the California congressman did in 2020, she will go off the exit ramp well before any votes are cast, but it will be mission accomplished regardless by officially assuming the mantle of internet troll and resistance figure without having to actually govern.

Additionally, Greene has become quite rich since joining Congress in 2021. Since being elected, the congresswoman has executed more than 450 stock trades and has shown a Nancy Pelosi-like ability to vastly outperform the S&P 500. Her net worth has reportedly jumped to more than $20 million despite having a salary of $174,000 per year. But any interview she does now only focuses on Trump and Epstein, never on all of these trades curiously going so very well.

The transformation of Greene is complete. And in the least surprising thing you'll read all week, there are actually those in the press who are gullible enough to buy her new act of humility and country-over-party.

“Remarkable interview,” New York Times journalist Tyler Pager gushed in an analysis of Bash's interview with Greene. “I see change from what we've seen. In some ways, some of the rhetoric she was saying sounded like Joe Biden: ‘There's more that unites us than divides us.' That is not the type of rhetoric we hear from Donald Trump and the MAGA base.”

Yep. Except former President Joe Biden was seen by a solid majority of people as divisive. In fact, an April 2024 Rasmussen poll found that just 9% of likely voters said Biden had done more to unite the country than divide it. Otherwise, solid comparison!

NATIONAL CONSERVATISM ISN'T THE FUTURE OF THE GOP

We live in a political world full of performance artists.

Greene is now leading the way on that front. And after years of being rightly mocked, she'll now be embraced by legacy media as courageous and evolutionary, all because of those precious sound bites from turning on the very president that elevated her in the first place.

This year, Associated Press reporters observed immigration court proceedings in 21 cities. Hearings repeatedly ended with cases dismissed by the government, allowing agents to arrest immigrants in courthouse hallways. AP reporters also reviewed internal records and spoke to judges, clerks and lawyers for the departments of Justice and Homeland Security to gain insight about the scope of the administration's effort.

The government lawyer knew what was coming as she stood inside a courtroom and texted an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent waiting in a corridor a few feet away.

“I can't do this,” the lawyer said in a text message as she looked at her docket of cases. “This is a new emotional load.”

“I understand,” the agent responded. “Hopefully we meet again in a better situation.”

Nearby, a Cuban man who had lived in the United States for years stepped from an elevator and into the courtroom where the government lawyer was waiting for what the man thought was a routine hearing.

The man was doing what the law required, and brought along his wife, a legal resident, and their 7-month-old infant.

Then the lawyer quickly moved to have the man's asylum claim dismissed and a judge agreed, making the man eligible for “expedited removal.” As he left the courtroom, the man was swarmed by plainclothes immigration agents who had been surveilling him. A struggle ensued and the wife's shouts could be heard from the hallway as the lawyer moved on to the next case.

The agent replied four minutes later: “Got him.”

Similar scenes of courthouse arrests, part of a makeover of the immigration courts under President Donald Trump, are playing out across the United States as his call for mass deportations of migrants is executed with unusually aggressive tactics. 

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.




Trump's pledge during his 2024 campaign, to impose hardline immigration policies was a major reason he won a second term. Now that Americans have seen how the his plan is being implemented, there are signs that many think he has gone too far. About 57% of adults disapprove of Trump's handling of immigration, according to a survey this month by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. 




Over several months, reporters for The Associated Press observed immigration court proceedings in 21 cities. Hearings repeatedly ended with cases dismissed by the government, allowing plainclothes federal agents to carry out arrests in courthouse hallways in close coordination with attorneys from the Department of Homeland Security. 

Screenshots of the text messages were obtained by The Associated Press from a government official who feared reprisal and provided them on condition of anonymity. The messages offer a rare look at how the nation's 75 immigration courts are churning out rulings in an assembly-line like fashion and how, for many people, the courtrooms have become deportation traps.

In a court system with a backlog of about 3.8 million asylum cases, families have been torn apart and lives upended. Due process seemingly is an afterthought. 

“When Americans picture a courtroom, there are a few core expectations” of fairness, dignity and impartiality, said Ashley Tabaddor, a former immigration judge in Los Angeles and past president of the National Association of Immigration Judges. 

“That's what makes a court — not a room with a bench or person with a robe,” she said. “But what we have here is a vision completely turned on its head.”

Over the past nine months, the Trump administration has fired almost 90 immigration judges seen by Trump's allies as too lenient, directed masked officers to handcuff migrants at closed asylum hearings and sent memos instructing judges to fall into line.

Unlike federal courts, where there are strict rules of procedure and judges have lifetime tenure, the Justice Department runs immigration courts and the attorney general can fire the judges with fewer restraints.




Nine current officials spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. Most expressed deep misgivings about punishing people who had followed the rules and showed up for court hearings. 

“As a government attorney, my duty is to uphold the law and protect the public interest — not to secure removal or detention outcomes by default,” a government lawyer wrote to the American Bar Association seeking professional guidance. 

But that is not how cases are often unfolding.

Courthouse arrests are coordinated days in advance to meet quotas with little regard for the particulars of a case, according to several of the U.S. officials.

According to one official, Homeland Security lawyers note on a spreadsheet which cases are “amenable” to dismissal, allowing an asylum-seeker to be immediately rearrested and placed in expedited removal proceedings. Most of those detained are men without lawyers who entered the U.S. alone and are expected to appear in court in person. Contrary to Trump's claims that he is targeting the ‘worst of the worst,' most don't have a criminal conviction, according to a Cato Institute analysis of ICE data.

ICE reviews the spreadsheet and selects which people it wants to pursue if cases are dismissed. On the hearing date, federal agents communicate directly with DHS lawyers, who act as prosecutors in immigration courts. The lawyer often provides near verbatim updates of the proceedings over text message to agents waiting outside the courtroom.

“Black shirt? Let me know if the judge dismissed,” an ICE agent texted during one hearing.

Almost from the outset, immigration courts were plagued by a lack of resources, authority and judicial independence.

The courts were established in 1952, but it was not until 1973 that “special inquiry officers” were given the “judge” title and allowed to wear judicial robes. The Executive Office for Immigration Review, or EOIR, was created in 1983. But that agency remained a part of the Justice Department, giving the attorney general authority to override decisions.

“We were a legal Cinderella,” said Dana Leigh Marks, who retired as an immigration judge in 2021 after a 34-year career. “No other court in the nation functions like this.”

The first Trump administration undertook a series of changes to reduce the case backlog, including instructing judges to deny entire categories of asylum claims such as for victims of gang or domestic violence.

It also set up a dashboard that would become the bane of many judges: Red, yellow and green gauges measure each judge's performance on goals ranging from completed cases — a minimum of 700 annually, regardless of complexity — to how many custody cases were decided on their first hearings.

To meet the metrics, judges must race through dockets, sometimes devoting mere minutes to evaluate asylum-seekers' claims.

“It's like deciding death penalty cases in a traffic court setting,” Marks said.

When Trump returned to the White House in January, his allies took direct aim at the court.

Since then, the Justice Department has issued 52 policy memos — more than the previous six years combined — making it easier to hire and fire judges and warning against pro-migrant bias. 

The memos highlight the courts' weakened status by referring to judges as “inferior officers” — a rarely used term taken from the Constitution.

In early September, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said he would lend 600 military lawyers to the immigration courts, about equal to the current number of judges. The goal, according to the administration, is to more effectively reduce caseloads by widening the pool of potential judges to include people already steeped in administrative law. But many migrant advocates are concerned the incoming judges lack the necessary experience to decide asylum cases.

“It makes as much sense as having a cardiologist do a hip replacement,” said Ben Johnson, executive director of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.

The administration has pushed back against criticism it is co-opting the courts to accelerate its deportation goals. In a statement, Justice Department spokeswoman Natalie Baldassarre said DHS decides whether to arrest migrants and that most judges consider it an “honor rather than an insult” to be called an inferior officer empowered by the Constitution and serving at the will of the attorney general. 

Baldassarre likened a record surge of asylum seekers during the Biden administration to an “improper conspiracy between DHS and the Immigration Courts to effectuate an unlawful amnesty for hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens.” The Justice Department, she said, had “restored the integrity, impartiality, and independence of the Courts.”

DHS did not respond to repeated email and phone requests for comment.

For some inside the courts, work has become a stressful, lonesome grind. Fear prevails. Resumes are being updated. 

One DHS lawyer described being haunted at night by the sound of jangling shackles of migrants the lawyer helped arrest. The lawyer joined the government after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, believing that protecting America's borders was a patriotic duty.

The lawyer still cherishes a signed copy of Nobel Prize winner Elie Wiesel's memoir “Night,” which was handed out at a work seminar. “Think higher, feel deeper,” reads the author's inscription of the book, which is marked DHS “Training Material.”

Today, its message torments.

“This isn't what any of us signed up for,” the lawyer said.

After a turbulent summer, the courthouses are starting to look lonely, too. With word spreading that a trap had been laid, many migrants, fearing arrest, are asking to appear online or are skipping hearings altogether.

Meanwhile, ambitious managers are publicly upbraiding those who raise doubts about the legality of locking up migrants with no criminal record in packed facilities. In a recent town hall with DHS principal legal adviser Charles Wall, several lawyers complained about the pressure, confusing orders and lack of resources, according to notes from the meeting shared with AP.

Wall said the pace is likely to continue for years, the notes say. When one federal employee asked about bringing firearms to work for fear of harassment by activists inside courthouses, Wall said that judges should not hesitate to kick out the public. Wall could not be reached for comment.

The harsh tactics have had one effect the administration wants: Voluntary migrant departures have soared, with more than 14,000 people seeking court permission to self-deport in the first eight months of 2025, according to federal data collected by Mobile Pathways, a San Francisco-based nonprofit that pushes for transparency in migration proceedings. That is more than the previous five years combined. The number is almost certainly an undercount because most migrants do not withdraw their asylum claim before self-deporting. 

At immigration court in Tacoma, Washington, the detainees came up one after the other with the same plea.

“I want to go back to my country,” a Venezuelan man told Judge Theresa Scala.

“I want to leave the country,” said a man from Mexico.

Immigrants know what they face: detention centers with ominous names — “Alligator Alcatraz,” “Louisiana Lockup” and “Speedway Slammer” — as well as workplace raids and neighborhood dragnets.

Tania Nemer believes she was cut out to be a judge. From the bench at immigration court in Cleveland, she prided herself on listening carefully to each person's asylum claim.

“There's a simplicity about it that I just loved,” she told the AP. “If you can provide justice in an efficient manner, you can really help a lot of people.”

The decision to apply to become an immigration judge in 2023 was deeply personal. Her father fled turmoil in Lebanon and arrived in Ohio at 16 with $6 in his pocket. He washed cars, learned English and eventually opened a namesake bar — Manny's Pub — that allowed him to provide for his family. When Nemer married, her wedding gift was the unspent dollar bills, so she would never forget her roots.

But Nemer's fondness for the law came crashing down Feb. 5. In the middle of a hearing, her supervisor opened the door of her packed courtroom and told her she needed to come with him.

“As soon as he said ‘Grab your ID,' I knew I was being terminated,” she said.

Still in shock, she was handed a two-paragraph letter, digitally signed by Sirce Owen, the acting director of the Executive Office for Immigration Review. It said she was being removed because the agency “has determined that retaining you is not appropriate, and we thank you for your service.”

No justification was given. But she thinks she knows some of the reasons: her Arab-sounding name, a history of previously representing migrants and diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, course work from Cornell University. She filed a discrimination claim with the Justice Department to find out why she was fired; the complaint was dismissed.

Nemer was the first judge fired after Trump returned to the White House. But 86 have been sacked since. Dozens more took the Department of Government Efficiency's “Fork in the Road” resignation offer.

The majority were hired under Democratic President Joe Biden and are still serving two-year probationary periods, according to a list of the fired judges obtained by the AP.

It is unclear who ordered the firings or how they were selected. But those removed granted asylum at markedly higher rates than their peers — in about half of all cases since August 2023 compared with 34% nationwide, according to Mobile Pathways. 




Among those purged were all 10 that appeared on the DHS Bureaucrat Watch List, a website created last year with funding from The Heritage Foundation, whose Project 2025 was a blueprint for the Trump administration's policies and personnel decisions.

The list includes names, Facebook photos, salaries and campaign donations for what it calls “America's most subversive immigration bureaucrats.” One target was Emmett Soper, a judge in northern Virginia who worked at EOIR headquarters during the Biden administration.

“As soon as I saw that, I knew the rules were changing, that I was under some kind of microscope that didn't exist before,” he said.

Tom Jones, the conservative creator of the website, declined to be interviewed.

Baldassarre, the Justice Department spokeswoman, said the department is not targeting specific individuals for firing but does continually evaluate all judges.

“All judges have a legal, ethical, and professional obligation to be impartial and neutral in adjudicating cases,” Baldassarre said. “If a judge violates that obligation by demonstrating a systematic bias in favor of or against either party, EOIR is obligated to take action to preserve the integrity of its system.”

The wave of firings and new directives from the Justice Department has had a chilling effect. Denial of motions to appear for hearings online tripled after a March memo repealing Biden-era guidelines instructing judges to generally grant such requests, according to Mobile Pathways data. Denial of continuances, which allow migrants extra time to seek legal counsel, have also spiked as have the number of cases classified as abandoned. 

Nemer returned to immigration court in October for the first time since being fired to represent a Mexican client she has known for 20 years and who was picked up by unidentified agents. While the man was jailed, his girlfriend, who was five months pregnant, miscarried.

Word of the former judge's return quickly spread and a stream of former colleagues came to the courtroom to hug her and express their dismay over her firing. 

“By the third hug I couldn't hold it in and just started crying,” she said.

Bug spray, sunscreen, fans and umbrellas compete with legal binders in the bed of a Toyota pickup across the street from immigration court in San Antonio.

This is the new office of American Gateways.

In April, the administration eliminated programs worth $30 million to provide free legal assistance to migrants, the vast majority of whom represent themselves in court. 

But lawyers for American Gateways keep coming, four times a week, setting up in a parking lot. The conference room they once occupied inside the courthouse is now used as a break room for ICE agents.

Assistance ranges from helping immigrants file motions to rehearsing what they will say to judges. When they can, they sign people up for virtual appearances to minimize the risk of arrest.

The gutting of the immigration court has driven migrants to one place where standards of judicial independence are upheld: federal court. 

Since May 15, when courthouse sweeps began, migrants have filed more than 3,000 habeas corpus petitions — to determine if someone is lawfully held in custody — seeking release.

The flood of claims threatens to clog the already crowded federal docket, which has little authority in immigration cases.

“The administration is attempting to press the gas at such an unreasonable speed without considering due process,” said Annelise Araujo, a Boston-based immigration attorney. 

One petition, filed in Miami, was from a Cuban man detained the same day he and his American wife and 10-month-old daughter were moving into their first home. Several petitioners said they had survived torture at the hands of gangs in Mexico, Ecuador and Venezuela.

Another legal challenge was introduced by an HIV-positive man from Brazil taken into custody four days after his husband died of a heart attack. With the body of Frederico Abreu's husband still at the funeral home, ICE officials knocked on his door stating they had documents belonging to the deceased man.

Those unable to afford a lawyer so they can sue in federal court have little recourse.

One was a man from Honduras who showed up at the northern Virginia immigration court with his wife and their infant baby. Another child, a son, unable to walk, pushed himself in a wheelchair studded with flashing, colorful lights. The family, fearful of further immigration problems, did not want to be identified. 

The judge denied a government request to deport the man. But seconds later, as the family stepped from the courtroom, they were stopped by four ICE agents.

The wife sobbed, hanging on her husband's arm as she pleaded: “Por favor, Por favor.”

The husband clutched the sleeping infant's carrier. Their son sat playing with a cell phone.

“I need you to go ahead and say goodbye,” an agent told the man. Crying, the man knelt to hug his son, who clung to his father, yelling repeatedly: “Papa! Papa!”

Finally, the father managed to pull himself away and started to leave with the ICE officers.

The boy tried to chase them. But the ICE agent was holding the back of the wheelchair as the boy futilely pumped his arms.

The Department of Homeland Security confirmed his July arrest. The family said he was later deported. Homeland Security said he voluntarily agreed to leave the country and returned to Honduras on Oct. 8 after three months in detention.

While former President Joe Biden fist bumped Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in 2022, President Donald Trump made a point to shake hands with the Saudi prince in 2025. 

Soccer superstar Cristiano Ronaldo was seen at the White House for dinner on Tuesday night, as his appearance coincided with President Donald Trump hosting Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

During the black tie affair, Ronaldo — making his first U.S. appearance in almost a decade — got a shoutout from the president.

"My son is a big fan of Ronaldo," Trump said during a speech to a group that included Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Apple CEO Tim Cook. "And Barron got to meet him, and I think he respects his father a little bit more now that I've introduced you. Thank you for being here, it's an honor."

Ronaldo has also shared how he feels about Trump, who recently said "he's one of the guys that can help to change the world" during an interview with Piers Morgan.

Ronaldo has been playing in Saudi Arabia for Al-Nassr in the Saudi Pro League. The 40-year-old signed a two-year contract extension to remain with the club, reportedly worth more than $400 million.

With Portugal qualifying for the 2026 World Cup, Ronaldo is set to compete in his sixth tournament next summer in North America. He and Argentina's Lionel Messi will make history when they step on the pitch as the only players to ever appear in six men's World Cups.

SOCCER LEGEND CRISTIANO RONALDO SAYS TRUMP ‘CAN CHANGE THE WORLD'

Ronaldo said this will "definitely" be his last appearance for Portugal on the World Cup stage. There was a question about whether he'd play in another tournament following the team's stunning loss to Morocco in the previous World Cup.

But Ronaldo has been playing for Al-Nassr since then, moving from Manchester United to the Saudi Pro League. While it was an unexpected move by one of the best soccer players of all time, he has embraced his new home, where he serves as an ambassador for the kingdom's tourism authority.

Trump has also been heavily involved in the sport, with his FIFA task force preparing for next year's tournament, which will be played in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

Trump announced the "FIFA Pass" alongside the organization's president, Gianni Infantino, on Monday — a new initiative for ticket holders around the globe who will be entering the U.S. for the World Cup.

The new system will allow World Cup ticket holders to receive priority interviews to obtain visas. Trump also noted that the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security have been working "tirelessly" to "ensure that soccer fans from all around the world are properly vetted and able to come to the United States next summer easily."

"I've directed my administration to do everything within its power to make the 2026 World Cup an unprecedented success. I think it's going to be the greatest, and we are setting records on ticket sales," Trump added.

The World Cup is set to begin June 11, 2026, and conclude July 19, 2026, at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.

            For more than two centuries, the Antico Caffè Greco has been part of the cultural landscape of Rome. Authors and artists, movie stars and princesses — even cowboys — have all made the pilgrimage to Via dei Condotti, at the foot of the Spanish Steps, to soak up the storied atmosphere of the Italian capital's oldest coffee house.
    


            Last month, that all changed. The café, a favorite for Romans and tourists, shut its doors. Portraits of former clientele — including Wild West sharpshooter Buffalo Bill — were stripped from its walls; plush red velvet chairs, seating booths and bar stools removed; gilded porcelain tableware carried away.
    


            The venue, as popular among Rome's 19th-century bourgeoisie as it was with the 1960s “La Dolce Vita” in-crowd, became an empty shell.
    


            Antico Caffè Greco's sudden demise was the result of a long-running rent dispute between its proprietors, Carlo Pellegrini and Flavia Iozzi, and their landlord, the Israelite Hospital of Rome. The hospital is a private institution that also provides healthcare to patients through Italy's national health service.
    


‘World's best' coffee shop for 2025 named



            It began in September 2017 when an 80-year lease expired and the Israelite Hospital raised the monthly rent from 17,000 euros to 120,000 euros — a leap from about $20,000 to $140,000. The move, it said, was in line with other properties on the street, which is home to stores that include Gucci, Versace and Dior.
    


            High commercial rents have pushed many small businesses out of the center of Rome in recent years, especially since the Covid pandemic when lockdowns fueled the rise of home delivery and online shopping.
    


            “We would be ready to pay more rent to keep the café open but not six times the amount we're paying now,” Pellegrini said when the Antico lease expired eight years ago. “I feel very angry, but we will fight this.”
    


            That fight was dealt a decisive blow in 2024, when the hospital finally won a court battle to remove the café's occupants. It's aim is to reopen the venue with a new tenant.
    


            Until last month, portraits on the walls reflected the café's past, including the day in 1890 when Buffalo Bill took his morning coffee there with some fellow cowboys. It was a favorite haunt of Charles Dickens, Henry James and John Keats in the 19th century. Later, Orson Welles, Audrey Hepburn and Sophia Loren all spent time there.
    


            Notorious 18th-century seducer Giacomo Casanova even mentioned a “tryst” at the café in his memoir. The sofa in the back where it was said to have taken place became popular with lovers over the centuries since.
    


            Despite above-average prices, customers always seemed to think sipping a cappuccino or hot chocolate from the same cups as Pablo Picasso or Princess Diana was worth paying extra.
    


            Pellegrini and Iozzi were formally evicted in October after losing five appeals and retrials.

            The café was shuttered with the help of the military police. The locks were changed and the heavy wooden doors closed for the last time. Lawyers for the hospital removed a temporary “closed for vacation” sign that had been taped to the doors since September.
    


            The court stipulated that the hospital must preserve the historical integrity of the property, but departing staff told CNN through their lawyer that they removed the café's artwork in September, which included portraits, sculptures and memorabilia said to be worth around 8 million euros, fearing damage from a leaking pipe.
    


            Antonio Maria Leozappa, special commissioner for the Israelite Hospital, told CNN the removed works and furnishings have since been seized by authorities and are now being protected by Italy's Culture Ministry until new tenants can be found. He said that the hospital was not seeking backpayment from Pellegrini for an annual 100,000 euros rent shortfall since the legal battle began eight years ago.
    


            “The Israelite Hospital is a public health asset, and the revenue generated by its properties has always been and will always be used by the Israelite Hospital, an institution affiliated with the National Health System, for the sole purpose of improving healthcare,” the hospital said in a statement in 2023 after having won one of many court battles.  It said the rent increase was an attempt to improve healthcare “for the benefit of all citizens.”
    


            Leozappa said the café will open again once work is done in the building. “It is a historic café, it is one of the first in Italy, it dates back to the late 18th century,” he told CNN.
    


            Under a new owner, the Antico Caffè Greco will “continue to enjoy a long history, respecting tradition and the established regulations, and the historic character of the place will be preserved,” he added. ”The city, Romans, and tourists will continue to enjoy their coffee at the Antico Caffè Greco for centuries to come.”
    


            Pellegrini isn't ready to give up the battle just yet. “The matter cannot be closed like this,” his lawyer, Alessandro Ciciarelli, said when the locks were changed.
    


In Turkey, your coffee comes with a side of destiny



            Whatever happens next, the once-grand space is now an eyesore on one of the most prestigious streets in the city center — one of many empty storefronts, some of which sit vacant for years, that have appeared as a result of soaring commercial and residential prices.
    


            The Antico Caffè Greco's wooden outdoor terrace now has signs that its empty planters are not garbage bins.” Curious tourists peer through the windows into the empty space. Inside, the lights are on, but no one is making coffee.
    


            “I came here every day for almost 15 years,” Manuel Capponi, an elderly local who lives at the top of the Spanish Steps, told CNN. “It is a tragedy that it had to close this way, the fights, the anger. But this café — and this city — have weathered worse storms. There will be another café and I'm sure the prices will reflect the higher rent.”

Fox News' Alexandria Hoff provides details on the ruling and the dissent from Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson

A coalition of 130 congressional Democrats filed an amicus brief to the Supreme Court urging it to rule in favor of two trans athletes in forthcoming cases over the protection of women's sports and national enforcement of Title IX. 

The coalition, which includes nine senators and 121 House members, is led by Congressional Equality Caucus Co-Chair Rep. Becca Balint, D-V.t., Democratic Women's Caucus Chair Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández, D-N.M., and Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii. 

The list of signees features prominent figures on the party's left wing, including Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Ilhan Omar, D-Minn. The list also includes House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Rep. Nancy Pelosi. The list does not include noted moderate Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., or Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.

The 130 Democrats on the list urged the court to side with Becky Pepper-Jackson, a trans teen from West Virginia who successfully challenged the state's law that prohibits biological males from competing in girls' sports, and Lindsay Hecox, who successfully challenged a similar law in Idaho to compete on Boise State's women's cross-country team.

"Categorical bans—such as the bans in West Virginia and Idaho—undermine those protections and the ability of transgender students to be part of their school community," the brief writes. 

Hirono wrote in an announcement of the brief, "All students deserve equal access to opportunity in schools—whether in the classroom, on the playing field, or in other settings. No student should be discriminated against based on who they are. 

"A categorical ban on transgender students participating in sports not only harms these students, but also subjects women and girls to harassment and discrimination, and leads to the policing of children's bodies. This contradicts the very purpose of Title IX: ending discrimination in federally-funded education programs. These bans are blatant discrimination, and the Court should say so."

The congressional Democrats are taking this position even as support for trans athletes in women's and girls' sports emerged as a weakness for voters and point of contention within the party over the last year. 

LEGAL DEFENSE TO 'SAVE WOMEN'S SPORTS' GRANTED RIGHT TO MAKE ARGUMENT TO SCOTUS AMID TRANS ATHLETE DISPUTE

In January, a New York Times/Ipsos survey found the vast majority of Americans, including a majority of Democrats, don't think transgender athletes should be permitted to compete in women's sports. 

Of the 2,128 people who participated, 79% said biological males who identify as women should not be allowed to participate in women's sports. Of the 1,025 people who identified as Democrats or leaning Democrat, 67% said transgender athletes should not be allowed to compete with women. 

The Little vs Hecox and West Virginia vs BPJ cases were each initially legal wins that enabled biological males to bypass their state's laws to compete against females. But now that the cases will be heard by the Supreme Court, a decision could have a wide-ranging impact on the legality of trans athletes in women's sports going forward. 

The cases are set for oral arguments on Jan. 13 in Washington, D.C. 

The Little v. Hecox lawsuit was initially filed by trans athlete Lindsay Hecox in 2020, when the athlete wanted to join the women's cross-country team at Boise State and had the state's law to prevent trans athletes from competing in women's sports blocked.

Hecox was joined by an anonymous biological female student, Jane Doe, who was concerned about the potential of being subjected to the sex dispute verification process. The challenge was successful when a federal judge blocked Idaho's state law. 

A 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel upheld an injunction blocking the state law in 2023, before the Supreme Court agreed in July to hear the case. Hecox then asked the court last month to drop the challenge, claiming the athlete "has therefore decided to permanently withdraw and refrain from playing any women's sports at BSU or in Idaho."

Hecox tried to have the case dismissed in September after the Supreme Court agreed in July to hear the case, but U.S. District Judge David Nye, appointed by President Donald Trump in 2017, rejected Hecox's motion to dismiss the case.

The West Virginia v. B.P.J. lawsuit was brought against the state of West Virginia by trans athlete Becky Pepper-Jackson, who was initially granted a preliminary injunction allowing the athlete to participate on the school's sports teams. The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the law violated Title IX and the equal protection clause. Now the Supreme Court has agreed to hear the state's appeal.

In a response brief, the athlete's mother, Heather Jackson, argued West Virginia's law that prohibits transgender athletes from competing in women's sports violates Title IX.

However, Title IX does not explicitly protect the right of biologically male transgender people to identify as women. The Trump administration and West Virginia state government do not interpret Title IX as protective of that right.

Meet the Future Perfect 25: Movers and Shakers.

In a year marked by devastating cuts to aid and horrible humanitarian crises, global health and development progress is at risk of backsliding. But then, there are those who refuse to cave in.

Every year, the Future Perfect team curates the undersung activists, organizers, and thinkers who are making the world a better place. This year's honorees are all keeping progress on global health and development alive. Read more about the project here, and check out the other categories:

Tackling global health from new perspectives, these leaders have channeled their expertise to create lasting impact. Their work spans high-stakes arenas, from pioneering massive new commitments to women's health to preventing biodefense failures. Others have steered national health system transformations — including making cancer treatment free for all. Then, there are those who are rebuilding war-torn nations, when attention has been diverted elsewhere.They are united by a deep-seated, strategic commitment to addressing child mortality and poverty and by their determination to make progress in the face of a perpetually challenging world. — Izzie Ramirez, deputy editor

If you're a parent, teacher, or cool aunt, you've probably heard of Ms. Rachel. She's every toddler's favorite YouTuber.

Informed by her (two!) master's degrees in music and early childhood education, Rachel Accurso started making singalong videos for her son back in 2019. He had a speech delay, and Accurso knew there was a gap in useful but fun content for kids like her son. Her finger was on the pulse. Her channel, originally named Songs for Littles, transformed into a global phenomenon. Some 13 billion views later, the Ms. Rachel cinematic universe now encompasses books, a fast-selling toy line, and a top-rated Netflix series.

It could have been easy for Accurso to focus only on making positive videos — the ones that toddlers can't stop dancing along to. She didn't. On her other social media platforms, Accurso has a direct line to caregivers and adults — and she uses it to advocate for the most disadvantaged.

Accurso has consistently used her immense platform to champion causes often avoided by public figures, speaking openly about her personal struggle with postpartum depression and brushing off conservative backlash for posting a Pride Month message last year.

Perhaps none is more moving than her unwavering commitment lately to kids in Gaza, where the malnutrition crisis — caused by Israel's brutal military campaign and continued reluctance to allow consistent aid into the enclave — has now reached “catastrophic” levels, according to UNICEF. There, more than 320,000 children are at risk of acute malnutrition.“Please look at her eyes for one minute,” she said in one video earlier this year, pointing to a picture of an incredibly malnourished baby, Siwar Ashour, whose haunting stare became emblematic of the crisis in Gaza. She also featured Rahaf, a three-year-old double amputee, and sang with her on one of her videos. Critics accused her of not “caring for all kids” after she raised more than $50,000 for Save the Children's Emergency Fund for kids in Gaza, Sudan, and Ukraine, among others. But she refused to relent.

“I have to just remind myself that kids' lives are more important than my reputation,” she told Glamour's Samantha Barry last month.

She's right. We cannot have a better, healthier future without considering the well-being of children. Food, water, shelter, education, and access to medical care are all basic needs that are crucial for human development, especially in those first few years of life. Accurso forces us to extend that urgency to every child.

“As an educator, you care about every child in your class,” she told Mohammed R. Mhawish, a journalist who escaped Gaza with his son, in June. “I've taught children from so many places and so many backgrounds. They all want to play, to learn, to laugh, and to belong. They are all innocent and precious. And geography does not change that.”

It has not been an easy year for women and girls around the world. Cuts to global aid threaten to unravel decades of progress in getting girls to school, keeping mothers safe, and bringing women into positions of power.

But there is one reminder that helps Anita Zaidi, head of the Gates Foundation's gender equality division, maintain what she calls relentless optimism: We've come so far.

“I get a lot of energy from looking at how much women have achieved over the last 100 years,” she told me last year. “Who would have thought that we would have gotten to where we are now?”

Zaidi, who is based in Seattle, is a pediatrician by training. She began her career fighting early child mortality in a small fishing village in Pakistan, her home country, eventually winning a $1 million prize to address malnutrition, improve vaccine and primary health care access, and train midwives and community health workers.

Over the past few decades, Zaidi has pioneered highly successful interventions that take seriously the idea that poverty, at its core, is sexist, and solving global health issues means taking into account entrenched gender dynamics and the role of women from the start.

Now, she has a lot more money to make that happen. In August, the Gates Foundation announced a new $2.5 billion commitment for research and development to improve women's health around the world. We're talking high-tech portable ultrasound devices, contraceptive patches that could be a game-changer for family planning, and simple postpartum hemorrhage drapes that can make giving birth much safer.

In other words, Zaidi still has plenty to be optimistic about. Investing in women's health is “not just the right thing to do,” she told PBS, but “a tremendous opportunity for coming up with new solutions in a very exciting area of science.” —Sara Herschander, Future Perfect fellow

After the White House began dismantling the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) early this year, it would have been easy for Caitlin Tulloch to throw up her hands in despair. Instead, the California-based economist did a very economist-y thing: She went to ForeignAssistance.gov and downloaded a spreadsheet.

This spreadsheet was a master list of all the 22,000-plus programs that USAID was funding. Tulloch realized that by filtering these programs to find the most cost-effective ones, she could direct interested donors to focus on funding them, thereby saving as many lives as possible.

She and her colleagues created Project Resource Optimization (PRO) to do exactly that. Soon, they'd narrowed it down to a few dozen programs — offering malnutrition treatment, safe water access, and more — that they labeled “urgent and vetted.”

In September, PRO announced, “More than $110 million has been mobilized, ensuring continued delivery of life-saving aid to an estimated 41 million people across more than 30 countries…Given the way these programs are targeted, a large proportion of those reached will be children under the age of five.”

What Tulloch did reminds me of a Leonard Cohen song — the one that urges us, “Ring the bells that still can ring / Forget your perfect offering.” We can't perfectly fix every problem in the world. But we can still make the world a better place for some. At a time when many Americans were just struck dumb, Tulloch rang the bells that still can ring. — Sigal Samuel, senior reporter

In August, biosecurity expert Beth Cameron co-authored a piece for The Atlantic called “No One in the White House Knows How to Stop Ebola.” She's right. And there is currently still no one in the White House focused on biodefense.

This is a tremendous problem because biological threats don't wait for a change of administration. We need competent people constantly playing defense.

Cameron would know. She's spent decades in and out of government playing a pivotal role in global health security efforts. She established and led the National Security Council's biosecurity office after the 2014 Ebola epidemic. Trump terminated it in his first term, but Cameron reestablished and led it under the Biden administration. She helped oversee the US global response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Her work was pivotal to launching the Global Health Security Agenda, a public-private partnership to defend against biological threats, as well as numerous other biosecurity initiatives. She served as the global health security consultant for the dearly departed USAID.

She also founded NTI | bio, an influential arm of the Nuclear Threat Initiative think tank focused on biosecurity (and, disclosure: my former employer, although unfortunately we didn't overlap).

Her current work as the senior advisor at the Brown University Pandemic Center is charting the course for a safer future as governments are backing down from their responsibilities on the health security front. She knows that it takes moments to destroy what it takes years to build — funding cuts have decimated America's biosecurity infrastructure — but she's not giving up. She's got a mind for strategy, extensive experience, and a deep commitment to protecting the world from biological risks.

“When you're in the middle of a crisis and you have to ask for money, you're already too late,” Cameron told 80,000 Hours, a career guidance nonprofit, in a 2017 podcast interview on pandemic preparedness. “Countries really need to be able to quickly detect and stop outbreaks at the source before they become epidemics. … we really need to be much better prepared to respond in real time than we were during the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.” — Shayna Korol, Future Perfect fellow

Raed al-Saleh has spent over a decade rescuing Syrians from the rubble in the aftermath of brutal bombings.

A co-founder of the famed White Helmets — a search and rescue organization that formed as a grassroots volunteer-led response to the Syrian civil war — al-Saleh stood before the United Nations pleading for that work to end last December. He slammed the international community for having “utterly failed” Syrians after nearly 14 years of war. “I truly dream that our work of pulling bodies from under the rubble will not continue,” he told AFP.

Just four days later, Syrian rebels overtook Damascus and the Assad regime collapsed, ending over half a century of brutal rule. But al-Saleh's work of pulling people from rubble, which earned the White Helmets global acclaim, three Nobel Peace Prize nominations, and an Academy Award-winning short film, shows no sign of stopping.

As of March, al-Saleh is no longer head of the White Helmets, which dug over 100,000 Syrians out of the rubble and provided a range of other emergency services over the course of 11 years. He is now minister of environment, emergencies, and disaster management in a new Syrian government charged with rebuilding a nation ravaged by war.

As part of his new role, al-Saleh is tasked with battling wildfires, clearing land mines, and repairing roads across the country, and his over 3,000 now salaried White Helmets have been formally absorbed into the country's emergency response force. The transition won't be easy. According to NPR, Al-Saleh now oversees a firefighting force in which White Helmets and Assad-era first responders slide down separate poles of the firehouse into the same fire truck, responding to emergencies side by side.

But it's been over a decade since al-Saleh left his pre-war job as an electronics salesman to help build the White Helmets from the ground up. And he has no plans to go back to his day job anytime soon. —Sara Herschander, Future Perfect fellow

Inside a tin mine in Rwanda, a fruit bat infected a worker with the deadly Marburg virus in September 2024. It was the country's first case of the highly contagious virus, a relative of Ebola, and initially, global health officials feared for the worst.

But by December, something remarkable had happened. In just three months, Rwandan health officials — led by Sabin Nsanzimana, the country's minister of health — made one of the largest Marburg outbreaks ever disappear.

How? Over the past three decades, Rwanda, a country once ravaged by genocide, has managed to pull off a wholesale transformation of its health care system. After years spent prioritizing health spending, and after building over 1,000 new health posts and a community-based insurance program, almost every Rwandan now has health coverage. Life expectancy has shot up by 26 years. Child mortality has plunged by nearly 78 percent since the turn of the century. It used to take most rural Rwandans more than an hour to reach the nearest health facility on foot, but thanks to a surge in new locations, most can now get the help they need in less than 30 minutes.

The country has also become a model in global cancer care, and just this summer, Rwanda's community-based health insurance program began making cancer treatments free.

So by the time the Marburg virus broke out, Rwanda was ready. It took Nsanzimana just 10 days to roll out an emergency vaccine trial for the virus. The country mounted a contact-tracing and surveillance response so quickly that doctors have wondered what could've been different had the world responded to Covid-19 with the same urgency.

The threat of the Marburg virus has passed, but Nsanzimana says the country's health care revolution is far from over. Next on his list is eradicating cervical cancer by 2027, dramatically expanding the medical workforce, and achieving universal health insurance coverage by 2030.

And if he could beat Marburg in three months, he might just be able to pull it off. —Sara Herschander, Future Perfect fellow

The roots of the world's most stubborn global health problems don't yield to vibes-based solutions. They surrender to data, rigor, and the surprisingly radical idea of actually trying to figure out what works.

Governments and nonprofit organizations depend on the economists, activists, policymakers, and writers who are reshaping how we understand poverty, health, and progress. They're the ones making sure that every dollar saves the maximum number of lives, that foreign aid is steered by evidence instead of dogma.

They're also the ones who are open to trying something new, such as giving the simplest solutions — like a plate of beans or a clear-eyed approach to masculinity — the platform they deserve. Because when it comes to making the world better, good intentions are just the starting line. — Izzie Ramirez, deputy editor

When the Trump administration sicced its newly minted “Department of Government Efficiency” on the US Agency for International Development earlier this year, for just a moment, Dean Karlan offered to help.

After all, as USAID's first chief economist, Karlan's life's work revolved around efficiency. His job was to help the agency stretch its dollars more effectively, save more lives, and propel US goals around the world. He has preached against waste, fraud, and abuse for longer than some of the DOGE bros have been alive.

“I'm not a political appointee,” he told me earlier this year. “I'm just a dorky wonk who was on detail and who cares about the evidence of impact.”

But it quickly became clear to Karlan that DOGE's wrecking crew couldn't care less about evaluating programs or prioritizing cost-effectiveness. His overtures to help went unanswered. Eventually, as he watched Elon Musk and Secretary of State Marco Rubio take a sledgehammer to relatively cheap, lifesaving initiatives like PEPFAR, as longstanding colleagues were sacked, and the agency denigrated as a “ball of worms” and a “criminal organization” that needs “to die,” Karlan did the only honorable thing left to do: He quit.

And, like thousands of other morally indignant ex-USAID employees, he can't stop talking about what's been left behind. While Karlan is the first to say the status quo wasn't perfect, the Trump administration's dismantling of the agency has been absolutely catastrophic for vulnerable people around the world.

Karlan, who's also a professor of economics and finance at Northwestern University, has kept busy since quitting USAID. He is the founder of Innovations for Poverty Action, a nonprofit studying solutions to global poverty, and ImpactMatters, a nonprofit that rates charities and was later acquired by Charity Navigator. He has spoken far and wide about what the future may hold, and he is currently working on a bipartisan plan to restore a semblance of American foreign aid the morning after the Trump era comes to a close.

Karlan is still hopeful that the US can one day rebuild the architecture behind its global aid strategy. And when that time comes, he'll be ready to talk efficiency — with anyone who actually wants to listen. —Sara Herschander, Future Perfect fellow

Concerns around the modern “masculinity crisis” — a catch-all term for worsening mental health among boys and men — has reached a fever pitch in recent years. And for good reason: Male suicide rates have been on the rise, men are working less, and boys are falling behind in education, among other troubling indicators.

As former Vox fellow Celia Ford has written, the crisis is “driving many young men toward the far-right ‘manosphere' — where anachronistic attitudes about women, society, and gender roles are resurging.”

Gary Barker, co-founder and CEO of Equimundo, a global research nonprofit working to “shift norms, narratives, and policies” around gender equality in the US and beyond, has been working for decades to build a counter to the manosphere attitude; it's what he calls “positive masculinity.” His vision replaces the increasingly regressive view of manhood, based on ruthless competition, aggression, and emotional detachment, with one based on vulnerability, kindness, and warmth.

That vision is being realized through Equimundo's innovative initiatives: The organization's educational and activities-based MenCare+ program reduced violence by men against their partners in Rwanda by over 40 percent in a randomized control trial. Similar trials in other countries that used Program H — the organization's program for young boys and girls — demonstrated positive effects, too.

Equimundo also operates the IMAGES survey to understand men and women's attitudes about gender equality, which since 2008 has interviewed 67,000 people in over 30 countries.

“We need to create space for more young men to be curious, to ask questions,” Barker wrote in a 2023 op-ed co-authored with Shaunna Thomas of the feminist nonprofit Ultraviolet. We need space for men, Barker and Thomas wrote, to “be unafraid and to explore a new, healthier model of identity.” — Kenny Torrella, senior reporter

Ken Opalo speaks about African politics the way some people talk about family: with affection, frustration, and an understanding of how hard it can be sometimes to make things work. At Georgetown's School of Foreign Service, where he teaches political science, he's made a study of Africa's legislatures, tracing how power actually travels through them and how, despite the obstacles, it sometimes finds its way to the people it's meant to serve.

Born and raised in Nairobi, Kenya, and then educated at Yale and Stanford, Opalo established himself with his 2019 book, Legislative Development in Africa, as a gentle challenger to the easy clichés about Africa. The text is academic, but it reads more like a diagnosis (or even a love letter). It provides an account of how governments across the continent have grown not just from colonial scaffolds but from the chaos, ingenuity, and sheer persistence that followed independence. Institutions, he reminds us, aren't dropped from the sky. They're built, brick by imperfect brick, through struggle, compromise, and — truly — luck.

These days, Opalo is wrestling with what he calls “the growth question.” To him, development isn't a glossy summit or a well-phrased aid campaign. It's about building states that work, schools that teach, tax systems that function, and putting in place leaders who answer to the people who elect them. “Without growth,” he says, “everything else is noise.”

Beyond academia, Opalo writes An Africanist Perspective, a Substack newsletter where he translates political economy into stories that feel as lived-in as they are smart. There's wit there, and weariness too. But Opalo is no doubt an optimist. He refuses to romanticize but insists that progress in the Global South will come because people refuse to give up on the hard, unglamorous work of democracy.

In both his scholarship and his storytelling, Opalo clearly believes the future is still being written by those who refuse to settle for dysfunction. —Paige Vega, senior climate and Future Perfect editor 

Pascaline Dupas is one of the more prolific and accomplished economists dedicated to reducing global poverty.

An economics professor at Princeton University, Dupas has published novel, highly cited papers on how access to banking affects small business development in Kenya, the effects of separating students into groups by achievement levels, and the power of distributing free bednets to prevent malaria, to name just a few. Her research has influenced British foreign aid, government policy in several African countries, the World Health Organization, large NGOs, and global health practitioners.

An avid collaborator, Dupas is also the co-chair of J-PAL — a network of hundreds of researchers conducting randomized control trials (the gold standard in research design) to figure out what policy interventions can best lift households out of poverty. In 2019, J-PAL's founders were awarded the Nobel prize in economics.

Dupas herself has been directly recognized for her contributions to the field; in 2015, she was named the Best Young French Economist by the French newspaper Le Monde, and years later, was awarded a prestigious Guggenheim fellowship. — Kenny Torrella, senior reporter

Paul Newnham wants to make beans sexy.

If that sounds weird to you, consider that beans are the healthiest, most sustainable (by far), most affordable protein source on Earth. Their richness in vitamins, minerals, and fiber make them an ideal solution to malnutrition in low-income countries, as well as to chronic diet-related diseases in wealthy countries. And they're diverse and versatile enough to be enjoyed in cuisines from every part of the world, from a garlicky Egyptian ful medames to an indulgent South Asian rajma.

But beans suffer from a PR problem. They're so cheap and they've long been so foundational to human diets that they aren't aspirational, generally falling by the wayside as soon as a country becomes rich enough to eat large quantities of meat. Newnham leads Beans Is How — a campaign founded at the COP27 climate conference in 2022, aiming to double global bean consumption by 2028 — to change that. With a coalition of more than 120 partners globally, the initiative has secured commitments to get more beans onto menus around the world, from school meals to high-end, culturally influential restaurants. Partner organization AGRA (formerly the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa), for example, has helped serve high-iron beans, or beans bred to have extra-high iron content, to tens of thousands of schoolchildren in Kenya.

Creative, ambitious work on beans has already been happening in siloes, from agricultural research to elite gastronomy. Newnham is unifying those efforts into an overhaul of the reputation of the humble bean, repositioning it as a sophisticated, modern solution for both people and the planet. —Marina Bolotnikova, deputy editor

The best case for why development economics still matters is being made on Substack. In his Global Developments newsletter, Oliver Kim — a Coefficient Giving research fellow — does something rare. He takes big, messy arguments about poverty, growth, and aid and rebuilds them from the data up.

That means puncturing zombie “facts,” as he did in a viral post explaining why South Korea was not actually poorer than Kenya in 1960. It's re-examining foreign aid's track record with fresh historical series, and writing crisp explainers on workhorse development concepts like exchange rates that answer all the questions you were afraid to ask.

Kim's work is approachable without being glib, and rigorous without disappearing into mathiness. It's also of the moment, focusing on how to direct scarce dollars and political capital toward what actually improves lives. That blend of clarity and empiricism is exactly what's needed at a time when the competition for every dollar of aid is so intense. Kim's writing is a compass you can actually steer by. —Bryan Walsh, senior editorial director

            President Donald Trump has promised to deliver $2,000 tariff rebate checks next year, raising hopes of a lifeline for millions of Americans struggling to make ends meet.
    


            “We've taken in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariff money. We're going to be issuing dividends…probably the middle of next year, a little bit later than that, of thousands of dollars for individuals of moderate income, middle income,” Trump said Monday.
    


            Although Trump has suggested these checks are essentially a done deal, the reality is there are major, perhaps insurmountable, obstacles standing in the way.
    


            Experts tell CNN it is improbable the federal government will send out $2,000 checks next year – unless it looks like the US economy needs to be rescued from an imminent recession.
    


            “It's highly unlikely there is some sort of stimulus check sent out next year. I would be pretty shocked,” Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics at the Cato Institute, told CNN in a phone interview.
    


            Bettors on prediction platform Polymarket seem to agree. They place just an 11% chance that Trump creates a tariff dividend by March 31.
    


            Perhaps the biggest obstacle is that the numbers don't add up.
    


            Tariffs are undoubtedly generating gobs of money for the federal government.
    


            Trump's new tariffs are projected to raise $158.4 billion in total revenue in 2025, and another $207.5 billion in 2026, according to estimates from the Tax Foundation.
    


            It's hard to say exactly how much tariff dividend checks will cost because virtually no details have been released.
    


            Still, the Tax Foundation modeled three designs for tariff dividends – and all of them would cost more than the new tariffs are projected to bring in this year.
    


            For instance, if the checks went out only to tax filers and spouses, and had a hard cut off at $100,000 in individual income, they would still cost $279.8 billion, according to the analysis. That's $121 billion more than projected new tariff revenue this year.
    


            At the high end of the scenarios analyzed, tariff dividends could go out to tax filers and non-filers as well as spouses and dependents. That would cost up to $606.8 billion – or nearly double the combined 2025 and 2026 projected new tariff revenue.
    


            That's a problem because the Trump administration has already held up tariff revenue as a way to offset the cost of the sweeping tax and spending package Trump signed into law earlier this year.
    


            “This is like the magic money tree. You just go to it anytime you need money. Of course, that's not reality,” said Lincicome.
    


            Another major problem is Congress would need to sign off on dividend checks – and it's far from clear there are the votes for that.
    


            Deficit hawks were already reluctant to back the president's tax law and this would only magnify budget worries.
    


            “I find it extremely implausible that Republican budget hawks are just going to be okay with blowing another $300 billion to $600 billion,” Lincicome.
    


            After topping $34 trillion for the first time in January 2024, the national debt has continued to mount, hitting $38 trillion late last month.
    


            There's no doubt many Americans could use $2,000 checks from Uncle Sam as they struggle to catch up to high prices at the grocery store, on car insurance and elsewhere.
    


            However, some economists warn that stimulus checks could backfire by worsening the affordability crisis.
    


            The problem is that while some people may use the money to pay down debt, others would likely spend it, and that would increase demand. As the last inflation crisis demonstrated, boosting demand without increasing supply drives up prices.
    


            In fact, many Republicans blamed former President Joe Biden's 2021 stimulus checks for causing the inflation crisis. That could make it difficult for those same lawmakers to support Trump-era stimulus checks.
    


            Academic research has found those stimulus checks contributed to the four-decade high in inflation, though they were hardly the only factor. Trillions of dollars in other stimulus, including Trump's 2020 stimulus checks and the Paycheck Protection Program also contributed.
    


            Even some Trump-friendly economists are highly skeptical.
    


            “Sending out checks to people is a bad way to stimulate the economy,” Stephen Moore, co-founder of Unleash Prosperity and a former Trump economic adviser, told CNN in an email. “If there is tariff revenue, that should be used to cut income taxes across the board. Stimulus checks only stimulate inflation.”
    


            Additionally, redeploying tariff revenue to pay for dividend payments risks sparking a revolt among the so-called bond vigilantes that drives up Treasury yields that set a benchmark for a number of loan rates. That in turn would make it even more expensive for small businesses to borrow and homebuyers to get a mortgage.
    


            “What Congress and Trump are trying to do with stimulus, the bond market could take away instantly,” said Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James.
    


            That's one reason stimulus checks are normally reserved for actual emergencies like the 2008 financial crisis or the 2020 pandemic.
    


            Beyond the budget, political and economic obstacles, there are legal ones, too.
    


            Most Supreme Court justices during oral arguments earlier this month sounded skeptical about Trump's reliance on emergency powers to impose his global tariffs.
    


            The Tax Foundation estimates the tariffs that could get struck down account for about 75% of the new tariff revenue coming in.
    


            “If the Supreme Court says the bulk of the tariffs are illegal, that could throw a wrench in the tariff rebate plan,” said Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation.
    


            For all these reasons, investors and economists on Wall Street are hardly counting on the arrival of $2,000 tariff dividend checks in 2026.
    


            “We've learned that late night Truth Socials are not a direct line to reality,” said Bob Elliott, CEO and chief investment officer at alternative investment firm Unlimited.
    


            However, one way Trump's $2,000 dividend checks could become a reality is if they become a necessity.
    


            If trouble in the job market intensifies and the unemployment rate climbs significantly, then the White House could argue direct payments are necessary to prevent a recession or minimize the damage of one.
    


            “It's almost like we shouldn't want stimulus checks to happen,” Mills said, “because it would be an indicator of something wrong. This is a break-the-glass, use in case of emergency tool.”

            The House vote to release the Jeffrey Epstein files was, in the end, 427-1. That's a margin typically reserved for proclamations and post office namings, not for what was perhaps the biggest defeat of President Donald Trump's second term, a fight that GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene declared on Tuesday had “ripped MAGA apart.”
    


            A group of Epstein's survivors, sitting together in one section of the House gallery, applauded. Democrats applauded. Some Republicans applauded. No one seemed to say much to Rep. Ro Khanna as he stood in the center of the floor, toward the front, chitchatting with colleagues. When Illinois Rep. Joshua Jackson patted Khanna on the back a moment later, it wasn't clear if he was acknowledging Khanna's work or just trying to squeeze by to get to someone on the other side.
    


            That morning, Khanna had noticed that Greene and Rep. Thomas Massie, his Republican co-sponsor on the discharge petition leading to Tuesday's vote, were trending on X and he wasn't. He is trying to be fine with that, as playing down the Democratic role to woo Republican support was always part of the plan. He offered a “Schoolhouse Rock”-like optimism about legislating, saying, “It feels like you can make a difference in Congress.”
    


            But Khanna doesn't hide his belief that Tuesday's triumph proves he should be taken seriously as a party leader and maybe even for the long-shot 2028 presidential run he is always happy to talk about. He argues the vote vindicates the value of his long relationships with Republicans – he and Massie connected years ago working on legislation to halt US military support to Saudi Arabia for its war in Yemen – and his willingness to talk to almost any party.
    


            “I make no secret about wanting to be part of shaping the national future of the Democratic Party of this country. I make no secret about the fact that I believe I have the best economic vision for this nation,” he said in an interview with CNN before the vote, ticking through his emphasis on forgotten communities abandoned by billionaires he says have rigged the system.
    


            “The knock on me from some — I mean, there are many knocks on me — but one of the knocks on me has always been: ‘Okay, Ro, you can write books on this, you can write op-eds on this, but can you really, brass tacks, get things done?' And it's easier if you're a mayor or a governor or a Cabinet member to show you can get things done. And what this is showing is, you know what? On one of the biggest things, which is getting MAGA on board, it's not just ideas. I'm able to get things done.”
    


            Others are willing to give him credit too.
    


            “It took him on his side and me on my side, and our working relationship before this, to be able to do this,” Massie said after finishing thanking the survivors at their press conference outside the Capitol on Tuesday morning. “Our chance of success was about 4 percent at the beginning, and we're going to succeed. So I am a little bit surprised. I'm used to fighting battles and not winning.”
    


            “I think Ro Khanna is a brilliant human being. I think he stands for justice. He's on the right side of history,” said Haley Robson, an Epstein survivor helping organize the trembling “sister survivors” who tend to arrive holding up pictures of themselves when they first met Epstein, speaking to CNN after the vote. “If it wasn't for Massie, Marjorie Taylor Greene and Ro Khanna, I don't think any of this would have been possible. They are just incredible people who genuinely care.”
    


            Khanna, a 47-year-old who represents Silicon Valley, has gotten used to often getting a better reception as the token Democrat on right-wing media than he does from some of his colleagues. This time, he'd like a little more credit for being ahead of the curve.
    


            “In the beginning,” he told CNN, “I'm not going to say who, but some of the folks in our own party were like, eyerolls, ‘There goes Ro on one of his issues…' ‘Why aren't we talking about the price of eggs?' ‘Why aren't we talking about the price of health care?' ‘What's up with this?' And I said, ‘No, there is something legitimate here.'”
    


            That included building a relationship with Greene, whom he said he barely knew before – but had never blasted on Twitter like so many of his colleagues – and now texts with. Or carefully maneuvering how to get Colorado Rep. Lauren Boebert in September to sign the discharge petition that forced the vote. Massie relayed that she'd do it if she didn't have to wait in line, so Khanna pulled the paper away from a Democratic colleague on the House floor and let her walk over and do it.
    


            To report about Khanna is to inspire exasperation from political journalists and operatives who've rued for years how many stories the congressman always manages to put himself into as the hinge point.
    


            But it's also to hear from a person who speaks to Barack Obama often that the former president keeps an eye on Khanna as an administration alumnus (Khanna was a deputy assistant commerce secretary in the first term, before launching a primary against an incumbent whom Obama endorsed). Without overstating it, the person said, Obama “appreciates that Ro is willing to show up across all varieties of platforms.”
    


            That gives Khanna a phone full of contacts to promote himself and his ideas, from MAGA podcaster Steve Bannon to forever never-Trumper Bill Kristol to  Larry Summers, the former treasury secretary and Harvard president whom Khanna is now disgusted to think he was on the phone with arguing about economic policy just weeks ago. The batch of Epstein estate emails released last week revealed Summers had been asking Epstein for advice on how to sleep with a mentee of his until just before Epstein's final arrest.
    


            “If there was no media attention to this,” Khanna said, “this thing would never have gotten a vote. So the idea of politicians being ambitious to raise issues they care about to the American public is a good thing, if the ambition is for a good public purpose. This idea that we should not be savvy about getting our message out in the media is setting us up for being ineffective.”
    


            A spokesperson for Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, who voted for and touted the win, didn't respond when asked what the Democratic leader made of Khanna's pushing the bill through.
    


            Rep. Don Bacon, the retiring Nebraska Republican who's become friendly with Khanna through their subcommittee work, argued Republicans always wanted to release the files, despite Speaker Mike Johnson in a floor speech on Tuesday calling the vote a distraction from “urgent legislative work.”
    


            “It could have been anybody” leading the charge, Bacon said. Then he reconsidered.
    


            “He was smart enough to get on it,” he said.
    


            At first, Khanna says, he took up the Epstein files cause because it was another way of sticking it to the elite class, the ones he travels the country talking about under his “economic patriotism” umbrella for shipping out their jobs and selling out their communities. But he was changed by what he calls the “emotionally horrific” meetings with survivors who started to come through his office — the guilt of having recruited friends, the trauma of being coerced, the women breaking down about how they've blocked memories of their own rapes and wanting the records of what happened so they can at least reclaim their own experiences.
    


            He should have listened sooner, he said Tuesday. He shouldn't have let it slide when he says he brought up releasing the Epstein files with former Rep. Elijah Cummings, the Democrat and House Oversight chair who died in 2019. He shouldn't have waited until Trump's backing off his promise to release them got him going in the spring.
    


            “Had I met the survivors in 2019 or 2020,” Khanna told CNN. “I would have been more vocal in the Biden administration. I think it is a fair point that all of us should have been more vocal earlier.”
    


            Khanna's father taught him to be stoic, he said, so tears don't tend to flow, but the anger does. This was insidious, he felt, “a rottenness in our civilization that allowed this to happen — like, how are we allowing these people to get away with this stuff?” he said.
    


            This wasn't about billionaires rigging the system, Khanna started to say. Men so rich and powerful and interconnected that they had means and the gall for a “rape island” and then to try to intimidate away any consequences represented something more: This, he argues, was about “the Epstein class.”
    


            Khanna doesn't know if he'll be invited to the bill signing Trump is now promising. He hasn't talked to the president since January 6, 2021, not that their relationship was ever much more than hellos at first-term bill signings and one chat in the Oval Office about a new term-limits law. He thinks Trump won't be able to wiggle out of his promise, or of complying, and believes there are too many survivors' lawyers and former Justice officials who've seen the files to know if they get selectively scrubbed.
    


            Khanna is already talking to Greene about joining together to try to ban private equity firms from buying up single-family homes. He wonders if he can get a few Republicans to extend Medicare to people starting at 55, even though he still favors Sen. Bernie Sanders' Medicare for All. Cutting defense budgets seems to have some crossover appeal. Maybe they can come up with a billionaire's tax that they'll say is all about taking on the Epstein class.
    


            “My point is, if your goal is just, ‘How do Democrats win,' maybe anti-Trump is enough for a moment. If your goal is, ‘How do we build an enduring majority, which is what progressive Democrats like me want to do?' This is absolutely essential,” Khanna said. “This is a proof of concept that we need to actually figure out how we bring disaffected MAGA voters into our coalition, that we need to focus much more on railing against a system that has screwed Americans and offering a hopeful message about how we help them, more than just meme-ing against Donald Trump.”

            Steve Rowson remembers the day he was first asked about helmets. An engineering student at Virginia Tech (VT) in Blacksburg, Virginia, at the time, Rowson and a few of his classmates were approached by the equipment manager of VT's college football team, who wanted to know what helmets were safest to purchase.
    


            Rowson and his fellow students found that data didn't exist. “So we bought the helmets that were available at the time, tested them all, and saw huge differences,” Rowson says. “We told our team which was best, they replaced all their helmets, (and) we made that data available to everyone. That's how the helmet ratings were born.”
    


            Those first ratings were released in 2011. Fast-forward to today, and Rowson is now the director of VT's Helmet Lab, overseeing the next generation of students using technology to study and test the way commercially available helmets in the US rate for protecting against head injuries.
    


            The lab has expanded far beyond football, Rowson says, to include hockey, equestrian, snow sports, lacrosse, cycling and others. It also includes areas outside of sport, such as head protection for construction workers.
    


            “The technology is critical to what we do,” he says. “If you think about what we first started doing, it wasn't an original thought. You can look back to the 1970s and see the suggestion of someone saying, ‘well, we should stick sensors inside football players' helmets so we can study head impacts.' The problem was the tech wasn't there at the time – it was too big, it was bulky, it wasn't accurate. And as we went through the years, the instrumentation got smaller, it got more accurate, and we got to the point where it's practical to use.”
    


            In Rowson's lab, helmet-clad, custom-built “head forms” are subjected to impact tests that include being dropped to the ground or hit by mechanical arms, while sensors inside the helmet measure linear and rotational motion, helping determine the amount of force on the head. The helmets are rated from one to five stars based on factors specific to the sport or activity.
    


            That information is made available to the public through the lab's website. Standard helmet safety certifications in the US are pass-fail, so the aim of the rating system is to provide a more detailed breakdown: did it just scrape by, or pass with flying colors?
    


            The lab gets its funding in a number of ways. Its initial bike helmet research, for example, was funded by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, and it also provides R&D and testing services for companies that make helmets. However, it says that its ratings are independent of all manufacturers.
    


            One of the students in Rowson's lab is doctoral candidate Caitlyn Jung. When she first started there, the focus was on adult bicycle helmets, but her latest research will rate youth bike helmets.
    


            “It's going to start with looking at how kids hit their head in terms of location and speed,” Jung says, which differs from adults; children are often riding at a slower pace and are closer to the ground than an adult. It might sound obvious, but the testing should reflect those circumstances, she adds, for “figuring out what helmets best perform in those impact scenarios that are most likely to happen in the real world.”
    


            For students like Jung, the work offers practical applications – helping athletes, coaches, equipment managers and parents make more informed decisions around head safety.
    


            “I'm most looking forward to the ability of consumers to just go and be confident in their decision of choosing what head protection device they want to use, whether it's a helmet in football or in a bicycling,” Jung says.
    


Join the Tech for Good community



            The conversation around head injuries and concussions in sport has been in the spotlight in the last two decades, especially within the game of football. Studies show a growing number of diagnosed cases of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in former players.
    


            In 2023, the Boston University CTE Center announced that nearly 92% of the 376 former National Football League (NFL) players they studied had CTE.
    


            While rule changes to the sport designed around safety have come into play, so have different helmet solutions – such as additional helmet coverings, which fit over the player's existing helmet. Since those first helmet ratings appeared in 2011, Rowson says he's seen interest grow among a range of industries.
    


            “It's really interesting to watch that industries are very engaged in what we do,” Rowson says. “They're interested, they're listening, (and) we're collaborating with them.”



            Ultimately, a helmet is “a safety product and it should be held accountable to how safe it is,” he adds. “People care when you're buying a helmet, how much protection it offers. So, when we started publicizing that information, it was like a light bulb to manufacturers: ‘safety sells' … and we've seen that across just about every single area we've evaluated helmets in.”

            The Trump administration admitted it “inadvertently” deported a transgender woman to Mexico this month after a judge ordered she not be removed to the country over fears she may be tortured or violently persecuted.
    


            The government has said it will allow Britania Uriostegui Rios, a Mexican national, to return to the US if she is able to make it to the border. Once she has returned, she will be placed back in ICE custody while the administration tries to deport her to a different country, court documents show.
    


            The case marks the latest example of the Trump administration wrongfully removing someone protected by court orders or special status as it works to carry out the president's goal of a history-making mass deportation program. Uriostegui Rios is at least the fifth such case this year, including the administration's dramatic legal showdown over the removal – and eventual return – of Salvadoran man Kilmar Abrego Garcia.
    


            Uriostegui Rios's attorneys are suing the administration and demanding that she not be required to return to federal custody once she is back in the US – “if she happens to make it to a port of entry without dying.”
    


            Mexico is one of the deadliest countries in the world for transgender people, according to the Trans Murder Monitoring Project. Though the full scope of risk to transgender people in Mexico is unclear, journalists and advocacy groups have documented pervasive – and often fatal – violence.
    


Rep. Jamie Raskin blasts Trump admin for wrongful deportation



            Since entering the US in 2003, Uriostegui Rios has racked up a lengthy criminal history that includes convictions for disorderly conduct, sexual solicitation and DUI, according to court filings from a Department of Homeland Security official.
    


            An immigration judge ordered her deportation in March after she was convicted of assault with a deadly weapon in Las Vegas.
    


            But the judge simultaneously blocked the government from removing Uriostegui Rios to her native Mexico, finding there was a likelihood she could face “torture” there.
    


            Even so, Uriostegui Rios was flown from a detention center in Louisiana to Texas on November 11, where her attorneys say she was taken across the border to Mexico without money, her daily medications or a cell phone. She was able to borrow a phone and call her attorneys, who say they were not notified Uriostegui Rios had been deported.
    


            “ICE confirmed that your client was removed to Mexico inadvertently,” Department of Justice attorney Shannon Smitherman wrote in an email filed in court. The next day, she wrote, “ICE stands ready to remedy the inadvertent removal by allowing your client to voluntarily reenter the United States if your client wishes to do so.”
    


            DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to CNN that Uriostegui Rios was “removed from the US and will be brought back to the US.” At the same time, the agency will seek another country for deportation.
    


            “The end result will be the same - Rios will not be able to remain in the US and will be removed,” McLaughlin said.
    


            The White House has not responded to a request for comment.

            Uriostegui Rios was being detained in a men's facility in Louisiana while the US government unsuccessfully tried to deport her to Costa Rica, Honduras and Nicaragua, according to court filings. In August, it began an effort to remove her to El Salvador, but the petition is still pending with Salvadoran officials.
    


            It is unclear what fears Uriostegui Rios expressed to the judge, but the legal definition of torture is vast and includes state-sanctioned violence, “cruel and inhumane treatment,” and prolonged mental suffering out of fear for one's life.
    


            When asked what threats Uriostegui Rios faces in Mexico, her attorney Bridget Pranzatelli told CNN she “is a trans woman who has been through extreme trauma, including being sexually trafficked by cartels [at] as young as 12 years old.”
    


            “As a result of these experiences, she has significant mental health issues,” Pranzatelli said. “There are many actors in Mexico who want to hurt her, which is why an immigration judge found it more likely than not that she would be tortured or killed if forced to return.”
    


﻿Since being sent to Mexico, Uriostegui Rios has been shielding her identity while sheltering with family out of fear they will discover she is trans and kick her out, one of her attorneys, Talia Lepson, wrote in a court filing.
    


            If Uriostegui Rios is able to return to the US, her legal team is asking that she be released from ICE custody and be allowed to go home under a supervision order, saying “the government cannot be trusted to follow the law” or court orders.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) used profanity when expressing his belief in the urgency of releasing files related to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

In an appearance on Meidas Media, Schumer let loose when discussing the documents, expressing distrust of President Donald Trump and his Department of Justice.

“I just had a meeting of 10 senators to discuss this — we got to make sure we get all of the Epstein files, all. They can't f*** around with this,” Schumer said. 

“They can't say, ‘Oh, we'll give you this but there are legal reasons we can't give you that,' and we are going to be pursuing them relentlessly to get everything because I don't trust this administration. I don't trust [Attorney General Pam] Bondi. I don't trust [FBI Director] Kash Patel. I don't trust the president. And they could screw around with this. It will be all of our jobs to be on them and make sure that we get everything,” he added.

The case involving Epstein received little attention in Congress following his death in custody in August 2019, but it re-emerged in July after Trump's DOJ stated that it had accepted the authorities' account of the circumstances surrounding the convicted sex offender's death.

EVERY HOUSE REPUBLICAN, BAR ONE, VOTES TO RELEASE EPSTEIN FILES

The announcement and ensuing angry reactions from Trump exposed a rare division in the usually united Republican Party, pushing congressional Democrats to make the issue front and center.

The House voted near unanimously on Tuesday to release the so-called Epstein files after a protracted struggle within the Republican Party. Trump eventually endorsed the release of the files, prompting nearly all Republicans to vote in favor.

Pope Leo XIV ignited a wave of criticism across social media this week after issuing a series of public messages calling for stronger climate action, expanded compassion toward migrants, and inclusion of transgender individuals.

The controversy accelerated after the pontiff posted on X on Nov. 16, urging world leaders to prioritize justice for vulnerable communities. 

“I urge Heads of State and the leaders of nations to listen to the cry of the poorest,” he wrote. “There can be no peace without justice. The poor remind us of this in many ways, through migration as well as through their cries, which are often stifled by the myth of well-being and progress, which does not take everyone into account.”

Social media users quickly seized on the post.

X influencer Vince Langman wrote: “Only on X could the Pope get ratioed.”

X's AI chatbot Grok pointed out the Vatican's extremely limited immigration policies, noting that citizenship is generally confined to clergy, diplomats, and staff, and is revoked once they leave their posts.

The criticism comes amid the Pope's broader push for global climate and immigration reforms. Earlier this week, Leo XIV renewed his objections to President Donald Trump's immigration policies, saying foreigners were being treated in ways that were “extremely disrespectful.”

Speaking to reporters at Castel Gandolfo, he urged Americans to “look for ways of treating people humanely, treating people with the dignity that they have.”

U.S. bishops have also amplified concerns about immigration enforcement. In a recent video message, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops said it was “disturbed when we see among our people a climate of fear and anxiety around questions of profiling and immigration enforcement.”

At the same time, the pope deepened his climate advocacy in a video address for COP30 in Brazil. 

He warned that “the creation is crying out in floods, droughts, storms, and relentless heat,” saying one-third of the global population now lives in severe climate vulnerability. He urged political leaders to act with urgency: “There is still time to keep the rise in global temperatures below 1.5°C … but the window is closing.”

Leo XIV argued that climate initiatives are not just moral imperatives, but also economic ones, saying, “Stronger climate actions will create stronger and fairer economic systems.” He also pressed governments to meet their commitments under the Paris Agreement, adding, “It is not the agreement that is failing. We are failing in our response.”

NICKI MINAJ SAYS NIGERIAN CHRISTIAN PERSECUTION DEMANDS ‘URGENT ACTION'

The Vatican faced additional scrutiny after the pope hosted the annual Jubilee Lunch for the World Day of the Poor, where 48 transgender women reportedly were invited but seated away from the pontiff's table. Church officials said the seating was random. 

Reactions to the transgender attendees were sharply divided online. X user “Wall Street Mav” wrote: “I didn't think it was possible, but this Pope might be even more radical left wing than the last one.”

The Washington Examiner reached out to the Vatican for comment.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Both Democrats and Republicans alike readied for a unanimous House vote Tuesday to pass a bill to force the release of the c ase files on the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. But in the end, one lawmaker stood alone in opposition: Republican Rep. Clay Higgins.

Higgins, who is in his fifth term representing a congressional district in southwest Louisiana, explained in a lengthy statement that he was “a principled ‘NO' on this bill from the beginning.” He raised some of the same objections that House Speaker Mike Johnson, another Louisiana Republican, had with the bill, yet even Johnson said Tuesday he would vote for it because, “None of us want to go on record and in any way be accused of not being for maximum transparency.”

For Higgins, a fervent Trump supporter and a member of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus, that wasn't a problem. 

He refused to give in to the building pressure, both within the Republican base and from survivors of Epstein's abuse, to pass the bill, even as both President Donald Trump and Johnson relented in their opposition to the legislation. He said that his concern with the bill was that it “reveals and injures thousands of innocent people — witnesses, people who provided alibis, family members, etc.”

“If enacted in its current form, this type of broad reveal of criminal investigative files, released to a rabid media, will absolutely result in innocent people being hurt,” he added.




Higgins suggested he would be open to voting for the bill if the Senate amended it to protect the privacy of those “who are named but not criminally implicated.” But just hours later, the Senate passed the bill through unanimous consent, leaving Higgins the only lawmaker in Congress on record against the legislation.

Yet Higgins is also no stranger to controversy. As a former law enforcement officer, he faced a series of allegations of misconduct and became politically involved after achieving viral fame by creating brash Crime Stoppers videos. It earned him the nickname by media outlets as “Cajun John Wayne,” and he's followed up the moniker by challenging people on social media to fights.

In 2020, a social media post by the congressman -- promising the use of force against armed protesters -- was removed by Facebook for violating the company's violence and incitement policies.

In Congress, he chairs the subcommittee of the House Oversight Committee that initiated a subpoena of the Department of Justice for the Epstein case files. But even when Democrats on the subcommittee convinced several Republicans to vote with them to issue the subpoena, Higgins was one of the few who stood opposed. He also pressed to have the subcommittee subpoena former President Bill Clinton.

“I've never handled a subpoena like this. This is some fascinating stuff,” Higgins said at the time. On Tuesday, he pointed to the oversight panel's work to investigate the government's handling of the Epstein, saying that it was being done “in a manner that provides all due protections for innocent Americans.”

Last year, Higgins also faced an attempt by Democrats to censure him for racist comments he had made about Haitian immigrants after Trump's own comments about the Haitian community in Springfield, Ohio.

In a social media post, Higgins called Haitians “wild. Eating pets, vudu, nastiest country in the western hemisphere, cults, slapstick gangsters.”

But after members of the Congressional Black Caucus, a group of Democratic lawmakers, confronted him about the post, Higgins deleted it and partially walked back the comments, saying they were intended for gang members.

At the time, Johnson defended Higgins, calling him “a very frank and outspoken person.”

“He's also a very principled man,” Johnson added.

The Super Bowl of tech earnings is nearly upon us, and the AI trade is about to get a crucial update that will either confirm or dispel a lot of investors' fears from the last few weeks.

Nvidia will report earnings for the third quarter after the closing bell, and the stakes are high. Any sign of waning demand for chips from companies developing AI models will likely further derail this year's rally.

Nvidia stock is down 10% month-to-date, but it's still up 35% for the year.

Wall Street analysts are mostly upbeat about what to expect from the chip giant's earnings, despite some of the recent jitters around the AI trade. They say that the results should reveal a continuation of strong demand that's carried Nvidia stock and the broader AI-fueled market higher this year.

Nvidia will publish its results after the 4 p.m. ET closing bell, and a call with analysts is scheduled for 5 p.m. ET.



The AI-bubble debate is raging ahead of Nvidia's earnings report, but there's nuance to be aware of if you're going to make the argument either way, Business Insider's Joe Ciolli writes in today's First Trade.

The AI-bubble debate is raging ahead of Nvidia's earnings report, but there's nuance to be aware of if you're going to make the argument either way, Business Insider's Joe Ciolli writes in today's First Trade. 

As Joe puts it: 

"No matter where you come out on the AI bubble debate, your next move will boil down to one thing: how long you're willing to wait.

If you're an AI bull that believes in the productivity gains that will be unlocked, you might be OK with waiting a long time for that to materialize. Or maybe it's the opposite. You want tangible results now, and that's impacting your investment decisions.

AI bears also face a time conundrum: Do they dump positions now and wait for any inevitable storm to pass? That can be risky. As investing legend Jeremy Grantham once told me, on a returns basis, it's just as damaging to sell too early than it is to hit eject too late.

So do these bears wait longer and try to time the market more precisely? That can be a stressful and high-risk situation as well.

Suddenly, the companies pouring tens of billions into AI — and getting the benefit of the doubt for their efforts — are feeling the heat. The group, which felt unassailable mere weeks ago, is now facing questions from investors: When is this going to start paying off? And do I want to wait around that long?"

CFRA Research also expects Nvidia to beat estimates and point to further progress in 2026.

In its earnings preview, CFRA forecasts 18% year-over-year growth and 18% quarterly acceleration, the highest since early 2024. It maintains that Nvidia will need to post revenue of $61 billion and EPS of $1.42 for the January quarter, which its analysts think is achievable.

"We believe consensus long-term projections remain reasonable, while NVDA's valuation at about 22x CY 27 basis is enticing given growth prospects and management's blue sky TAM vision of $3T-$4T by decade's end," stated equity analyst Angelo Zino.

CFRA reiterates its strong buy rating for Nvidia and maintains its bullish $270 price target.

DA Davidson's Gill Luria says his team doesn't think AI demand is set to slow in the coming year.

He said that despite negative speculation and jitters around valuations, the firm believes Nvidia will maintain its dominance, even if competition rises and trade tensions with China persist.

He said that despite negative speculation and jitters around valuations, the firm believes Nvidia will maintain its dominance, even if competition rises and trade tensions with China persist.

"We would point towards recent guidance given by management during NVIDIA GTC D.C. that has Blackwell/Rubin generations amounting to $500B of revenue off of 20M GPUs sold with 30% of that already being shipped," Luria stated.

Davidson has a $250 price target for Nvidia, valuing the stock at 42 times estimated 2026 earnings and implying a jump of about 39%.

UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri predicts that Nvidia's revenue will come in slightly above Wall Street estimates at $56 billion. His team predicts Nvidia's calendar EPS will reach $7.75 per share in 2026 and could go as high as $9.50 per share in 2027.

"A big focus of the call will clearly be how quickly all of this AI infrastructure can be installed and any customer concentration risks that may develop."

The analyst urged investors to "stay the course" with Nvidia stock, maintaining a price target of $230, 28% higher than current levels.

Bank of America believes Nvidia remains undervalued, given its dominance in the AI hardware space. Analyst Vivek Arya reaffirmed a buy rating and updated the bank's per-share estimates for the coming fiscal year to $4.56, $7.02, and $9.15 per share.

While Arya notes that Nvidia may flick at a complicated macro outlook in the earnings call, he expects the micro outlook to remain solid. Additionally, his team is optimistic that Nvidia's product pipeline, the Blackwell, Blackwell Ultra, and Vera Rubin chips, will help drive growth in 2026.

Perplexity on Wednesday announced it will roll out a free agentic shopping product for U.S. users next week, as consumers ramp up spending for the holiday season. 

"The agentic part is the seamless purchase right from the answer," Dmitry Shevelenko, Perplexity's chief business officer, told CNBC in an interview. "Most people want to still do their own research. They want that streamlined and simplified, and so that's the part that is agentic in this launch."

The artificial intelligence startup has partnered with PayPal ahead of the launch, and users will eventually be able to directly purchase items from more than 5,000 merchants through Perplexity's search engine. 

Perplexity initially released a shopping offering called "Buy With Pro" for its paid subscribers late last year. The company said its new free product will be better at detecting shopping intent and will deliver more personalized results by drawing on memory from a user's previous searches. 

Perplexity declined to share whether it will earn revenue from transactions that are completed through its platform.

The startup's competitor OpenAI announced a similar e-commerce feature called Instant Checkout in September, which allows ChatGPT users to buy items from merchants without leaving the chatbot's interface. OpenAI has said it will take a fee from those purchases. 

Etsy and Shopify were named as OpenAI's initial partners for Instant Checkout, but it also inked a deal with PayPal late last month. 

Starting next year, PayPal users will be able to buy items, and PayPal merchants will be able to sell items through ChatGPT.

Michelle Gill, who leads PayPal's agentic strategy, said the company has been building out infrastructure and protections as AI ushers in the "next era of commerce." 

Part of that means keeping consumers and merchants connected to PayPal as they engage on new platforms like Perplexity, she said. 

Perplexity said PayPal merchants will serve as the merchants of record through its agentic shopping product, which will allow them to handle processes like purchases, customer service and returns directly. 

Through its "Buy With Pro" offering, Perplexity had served as the intermediary that completed purchases.

Gill said PayPal's buyer protection policies, which can help users get reimbursed if there are problems with their orders, will also apply to transactions on Perplexity.

"We're really excited about this launch because we will see it come to life during a period that's so organic for people to shop," Gill said in an interview.

MP Materials surged Wednesday on a deal with the U.S. Department of Defense and the Saudi Arabian Mining Company, Maaden, to develop a rare earth refinery in the kingdom. 

The U.S. rare earth miner's stock was last up about 9%. 

MP and the Pentagon will hold a 49% stake in the joint venture, the company said. Maaden's position will be no less than 51%. The Defense Department will finance the U.S. portion of the venture with MP providing technical and marketing expertise. 

The binding agreement to form the joint venture comes after MP and Maaden signed a memoranum of understanding back in May. The agreement will "significantly expand MP's global footprint" and is structured to "ensure U.S. oversight and alignment with national security objectives," the company said.

MP is also holding talks on a possible collaboration to standup magnet manufacuring in Saudi Arabia. 

The Pentagon struck a landmark deal with MP in July that includes an equity stake, a price floor, and offtake agreement. The Trump administration is investing in MP as it seeks to reduce U.S. dependence on China for rare earth imports and stand up a domestic supply chain. 

MP CEO James Litinsky has described the company as the U.S. "national champion" for rare earths. Rare earths are crucial inputs in U.S. weapons platforms, electric vehicles, clean energy technology, semiconductor manufacturing and consumer electronics. 

Goldman Sachs initiated converage of MP on Tuesday with a price target of $77, implying about 32% upside from Monday's closing price. 

"We believe MP's downstream expansion into refining and magnet production, accelerated by a partnership with the US government, will strategically position MP as a key supply chain component for rare earth refining and magnet production," Goldman analyst Brian Lee told clients.

Brett Johnson spent over a decade breaking into systems, stealing identities, and selling stolen credit cards on the dark web. He stole millions of dollars, often making over $100,000 a month through tax-return identity theft.

He's worked with the Secret Service and private companies as a consultant to help stop the kinds of crimes he once perpetrated. He told Business Insider's Carter Thallon in a recent interview that the crime world he helped invent is mutating into something harder to see — and almost impossible to stop.

Cybercrime is becoming increasingly organized, and that's a problem, he said. The next wave of cybercrime will come from entire operations powered by artificial intelligence, where machines write the scams, fake the evidence, and even talk to the victims in real time.

Here are the three rising cyber threats that alarm him most.

Johnson said deepfakes that convincingly mimic real people will become central to online fraud. Criminals already use them to forge voice messages and fake live video calls. Soon, this technology will make it impossible to trust what we see or hear online, Johnson said.

"In order for me to defraud you, I have to get you to trust me," he said. However, deepfakes enable criminals to essentially bypass the effort of gaining trust by posing as an already trustworthy person, accelerating the process of victimizing you.

One finance clerk, last year, for example, was conned into approving overseas transfers amounting to more than $25 million, Shubham Agarwal reported for BI. The clerk had been instructed to do so during a video call that turned out to be full of deepfakes recreations of his real coworkers, including the organization's chief financial officer.

"We get to the point where we're no longer able to trust anything that we see or hear in an online environment, and that becomes really dangerous," he said.

That threat is compounded by the speed of AI tools, which can mimic speech patterns, create realistic faces, and write messages tailored to a target's personality.

Gone are the days when fraudsters acted alone, Johnson said. Scam farms are becoming the new norm.

Scam farms are buildings packed with workers — who are often trafficked or forced into slave labor — running simultaneous cons.

Some of these operations specialize in "pig butchering," long-term relationship scams that drain victims' savings.

That's exactly what happened to Ahmet Tozal, who recently told BI's Matthew Loh of a relationship he built with a supposed woman online.

Over several weeks, the woman convinced him to invest over a year's worth of his wages into a cryptocurrency that didn't exist. He ultimately had to move from Turkey to Uzbekistan alone to find a higher salary to support his family.

These scam farms are structured businesses, with workers rotating shifts and supervisors overseeing them. "That's something we didn't see back then," Johnson said about the time he was scamming people in the 90s and early 00s.

"Back then, you did see criminals working together, networking in a co-op type fashion. But these days it's much more organized," he added.

The same automation fueling deepfakes is driving identity fraud to a new level.

Johnson calls synthetic identity fraud — a blend of real and fake personal data used to create a new digital person — the No. 1 form of identity theft in the world.

It's especially concerning because "synthetic fraud is almost invisible because that person doesn't really exist," he said, adding that "it's 80% of all new account fraud. It's 20% of all credit card chargebacks, 5% of all credit card debt. It's huge."

Once a fake identity establishes credit, it can be used to open bank accounts, apply for loans, or facilitate money laundering. Banks often discover the fraud only after the accounts vanish. If synthetic IDs continue to rise, it could make fraud detection exponentially harder.

Fraud is easier to achieve now than ever before. "A criminal now doesn't have to understand any aspect of the crime. They can immediately buy tutorials, take live instruction classes, buy anything that they need online, and immediately start being successful and profitable at crime," Johnson said.

So it's important to know how to protect yourself. Johnson told BI's Manseen Logan earlier this year, six ways to lower your risk of hacking:

Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang will speak in Washington at the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum Wednesday at The Kennedy Center. 

The two tech moguls will discuss artificial intelligence, advanced computing and digital infrastructure with Abdullah A. Alswaha, Saudi Arabia's communications and technology information minister.

The event comes a day after President Donald Trump met with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at the White House. It was their first meeting since Trump's trip to Saudi Arabia in May. 

During the Tuesday visit, the White House said the kingdom upped its initial $600 billion trade and investment commitment to the U.S. to $1 trillion.

Musk and Huang also attended a dinner that Trump held for the crown prince later that night. 

The dinner marked Musk's first appearance at the White House since his feud with Trump in June, when the two traded barbs on X after the Tesla CEO criticized the president's tax-and-spending-cut bill.

Walmart is in talks to buy a startup called R&A Data, a company founded by two Israeli scientists that works to reduce scams and counterfeits on online marketplaces, according to people familiar with the matter and records reviewed by CNBC. 

The potential acquisition would come at a key time for the largest U.S. retailer as incoming CEO John Furner prepares to take the helm early next year. Walmart's third-party marketplace has become a central part of the company's strategy to increase profits faster than sales, and has helped it expand its e-commerce business, which grew 25% in the U.S. in its most recently reported quarter. 

The company has said it added hundreds of millions of product listings to the platform in recent years, growth that experts say increases the need for tools to detect issues with items.

R&A Data has been working with Walmart as a third-party vendor since at least 2024, helping the company screen listings on its online marketplace for compliance issues, such as counterfeiting, according to the people and records. After working with the tech startup, Walmart decided to acquire it, CNBC learned.

Additional details about the possible deal weren't immediately clear. Walmart, which is due to report fiscal third-quarter earnings on Thursday, didn't return multiple requests for comment from CNBC. R&A Data declined to comment.

The news comes two months after CNBC published an investigation into Walmart's online marketplace that found the company made its seller and product vetting controls more lax over time as it looked to grow the platform and take market share from Amazon. Third-party online sales have become a critical growth engine for Walmart, as the retailer moves to offer a wider variety of items to a larger base of shoppers.

During its investigation, CNBC found at least 43 third-party sellers that had used the identity of another business to set up their account. CNBC authenticated 20 beauty products and supplements offered by the sellers who had used the identity of a different business, and all of those products were determined to be counterfeit, according to brands that make the products or outside lab testing.

After CNBC shared the results of its investigation, Walmart said "trust and safety are non-negotiable for us." 

"Counterfeiters are bad actors who target retail marketplaces across the world, and we are aggressive in our efforts to prevent and combat their deceptive behavior," Walmart said at the time. "We enforce a zero-tolerance policy for prohibited or noncompliant products and continue to invest in new tools and technologies to help ensure only trusted, legitimate items reach our customers."

To combat counterfeits and other scams, marketplaces generally need a two-pronged approach, experts previously told CNBC. They said platforms need to have firm onboarding and vetting protocols to ensure bad actors aren't joining to begin with, and ongoing monitoring of listings to prevent the sale of dangerous, fake or illegal products. 

A Walmart acquisition of R&A could help it monitor the hundreds of millions of product listings it hosts on its platform to ensure they're compliant with its rules, according to the people familiar with the matter.

Founded in 2022 by entrepreneurs Noam Rabinovich and Raz Abramov, both former members of the Israel Defense Forces' intelligence unit, R&A Data uses artificial intelligence to monitor listings for compliance, according to the people, the founders' LinkedIn profiles, interviews they've given in the past and R&A's website. 

There's little public information about R&A Data but its website, which was taken down some time in the last two months, described the company as "your partner in portfolio safety." 

"Scan millions of listings and products at lightning speeds, with incredible accuracy; our AI-powered platform delivers reliable, dependable protection, at scale," the website said, according to an archive of the page captured on Sept. 5. 

People interested in the software could submit their contact details for further information, but the website said registration for early access was "full" and it was "not accepting any further sign-ups." 

"If you would like to be considered for 2025 access please submit your details," the website said. 

Rabinovich and Abramov previously founded another company, EverC, which helps online platforms and other firms detect and remove risky merchants, money laundering schemes, fake, illegal and dangerous products, and other compliance challenges, according to its LinkedIn page. Rabinovich left the company in October 2022, while Abramov departed in February 2023, according to their LinkedIn pages.

To stand out in today's job market, it's crucial to go "one step beyond" other candidates by polishing your personal narrative and preparing for tricky interview questions.

Candidates who are able to provide clear, calm and thoroughly researched answers will stand out to hiring managers, according to Madeline Mann, founder of career coaching business Self Made Millennial and author of "Reverse the Search: How to Turn Job Seeking into Job Shopping."

In her experience, one interview question that frequently trips up job seekers is: "Where do you see yourself in five years?"

It's "kind of an impossible question," Mann says. Nobody really knows what their future career will look like, but the question "gets so many job seekers rejected — and they don't realize it."

Your response should demonstrate to hiring managers how your goals and experience "fit into this role," she says.

Here's her best advice for job seekers on how to tackle this interview question.

From a hiring manager's perspective, the purpose of this question is to figure out if candidates are sincerely interested in the job and whether it aligns with their career ambitions, according to Mann.

Many job seekers inadvertently "prove that this role isn't in their trajectory" by sharing future goals that have nothing to do with it, Mann says.

"They'll say things like, 'I hope to open my own business in five years,' or, 'I hope to get married in five years," she says. Answers that focus on entrepreneurship or personal milestones can "give the impression that this person might be a flight risk," Mann says.

Companies are looking to hire employees who will stick around for the long term, according to Mann, not ones who are already planning their exits.

Finally, don't tell the interviewer, "I want your job in five years," Mann says — you'll seem arrogant and unrealistic.

Mann recommends focusing on tangible career outcomes instead of on job titles or promotions in your answer. She recommends thinking of the question as: "How is this role favorable to my trajectory?" she says.

Rather than saying, "I expect myself to be the director of this department" in five years, candidates should focus on the steps they would take to achieve that, she says.

"Maybe I'd say, 'I'd like to be taking on more direct reports,' or, 'I'd like to be owning bigger accounts, and I would like to be the go-to person in the organization for expertise,' or, 'I'd like to be speaking on bigger stages,'" she says.

All of these examples are "the product of excelling to the next stage," Mann says.

"Instead of just saying, 'I'm chasing a title,' you're saying, 'I'm chasing outcomes that are going to be beneficial to the business,'" she says.

Overall, your answer should be "in flow with the role," Mann says: It'll show the company that you plan to stick with the job, but continue "achieving at higher and higher levels."

U.S. President Donald Trump trumpeted Saudi Arabia's $1 trillion investment pledge in the States and the potential sale of American fighter jets to Riyadh, but experts say there are lingering doubts over whether such deals will materialize.

Trump rolled out the red carpet for Saudi's de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as he arrived in Washington on Tuesday for talks ranging from security to civil nuclear energy partnerships. The leaders signed a defense cooperation pact and held discussions about the potential sale of American F-35 fighter jets to the kingdom. 

The U.S. visit by Mohammed bin Salman (or MBS, as he's widely known) was not without controversy as it was the first time he had visited the States since the killing of Saudi critic and journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. 

U.S. intelligence determined that the crown prince had approved the operation that led to Khashoggi's death in a Saudi consulate in Istanbul, but Riyadh denied any involvement in the murder.

Undeterred by global outrage over the death of Khashoggi, and question marks over Saudi Arabia's rehabilitation and invitation to the White House, Trump and MBS said they had "finalized a series of landmark agreements that deepen the U.S.-Saudi strategic partnership."

Among them, the White House said in a statement, was Saudi's pledge to increase the $600 billion worth of investments in the U.S. that it made in May, to $1 trillion. The White House said the bump reflected "deepening trust and momentum for the United States under President Trump's leadership."

No further detail was given as to a time-scale around that trillion-dollar investment, however.

A $1 trillion investment is equal to Saudi Arabia's annual economic output in 2023 (of $1.07 trillion) and economists questioned whether that level of investment would, or could, materialize any time soon. 

"These sort of pledges have become regular features of the international landscape, even when, as in the case of the EU [and it's pledged investment in the U.S. as part of a trade deal] there's absolutely no enforcement mechanism available," Paul Donovan, chief economist at GBS Global Wealth Management, noted Wednesday.

"To put the Saudi pledge in context, that is the equivalent of almost an entire year's GDP [gross domestic product] for the kingdom. The pledge may not therefore be honored in the near term," he cautioned. 

In addition to the investment pledges, Trump and MBS discussed the sale of F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia, with the kingdom reportedly looking to buy as many as 48 of the stealth fighter jets in what would be a multibillion-dollar deal. 

The president "approved a major defense sale package, including future F-35 deliveries, which strengthens the U.S. defense industrial base and ensures Saudi Arabia continues to buy American," the White House said. But no details were given on the number of planes sold, or any timeframe for their supply.

Such a sale could prove controversial with U.S. lawmakers whose sympathies and allegiance has traditionally leant toward Israel, the U.S.' main and longstanding ally in the Middle East. 

Israel is currently the only country in the Middle East to have F-35s and any sale of such advanced stealth technology to Saudi Arabia could be seen as risky, having the potential to shift military and power dynamics in the fractious region.  For its part, the IDF is reportedly unhappy at the prospect of F-35 deal with Saudi Arabia, warning that Israel's air superiority in the region would be jeapardized.

Trump shrugged off those concerns, telling reporters in the Oval Office on Tuesday that: "We'll be selling F-35s," although he alluded to Israel's discontent, noting: "This [Saudi Arabia] is a great ally, and Israel is a great ally."

"I know they'd like you to get planes of reduced calibre, but as far as I'm concerned, I think they are both at a level where they should get top of the line," he added.

Analysts say giving Saudi Arabia F-35s before it has signed the Abraham Accords thereby normalizing relations with Israel, would be a reward too far for Riyadh.

"Saudi Arabia is an important U.S. security partner, and increasing bilateral defense cooperation can further common interests and support efforts to build a regional security architecture that more effectively deters and defeats aggression," Bradley Bowman, a senior director at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said in analysis.

"However, before providing Riyadh with the F-35, Washington should address concerns related to Riyadh's relationship with China, follow the law regarding Israel's Qualitative Military Edge, and demand that Saudi Arabia first normalize relations with Israel."

Lingering and deep-seated differences over a two-state solution could give the White House reasons to hesitate over the supply of F-35s to Saudi Arabia, analysts noted. 

"It's one thing to announce big deals. It's one thing to announce that Saudi Arabia will be permitted to buy the F 35 this advanced stealth fighter, but it's another thing to actually have planes touching down and taking off from Saudi runways," Paul Musgrave, associate professor of Government at Georgetown University in Qatar, told CNBC Wednesday. 

"And between here and there, there's a lot of details. And when you start to get into the details about who's going to transfer what technology at what point, that's where Congress — which is, I think fair to say, a little bit more friendly toward Israel than to towards Saudi Arabia — is going to have some input." 

"Now, that's not to say that this deal is not going to go through because, of course, Israel also has suffered some reverses in its public standing, but there is going to be, I think probably, a decently long road between where we are and where we get to," he told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe."

Porsche on Wednesday revealed an all-electric version of its Cayenne SUV, calling it the "most powerful" production vehicle ever made by the German sports car manufacturer.

The 2026 Cayenne EV is capable of 1,139 horsepower, 0-60 mph in 2.4 seconds and up to 1,106 foot-pounds of torque, according to Porsche. Its top speed is up to 162 mph, the company said. 

The car that previously had the title of "most powerful road-legal Porsche" was the Taycan Turbo GT at 1,019 horsepower.

To achieve the vehicle's peak performance, Porsche said a launch mode needs to be activated. In normal driving mode, the vehicle features up to 844 horsepower.

A top-end "Turbo Electric" model starts at $163,000 — making it among the most expensive Porsches on sale. A standard model with less performance — 402 horsepower and 615 foot-pounds of torque — starts at $109,000.

The Cayenne Electric features a 113 kilowatt-hour battery and 800-volt electrical architecture system that's capable of charging from 10% to 80% in less than 16 minutes, Porsche said. The new EV also is the first Porsche to have the option for inductive, or wireless, charging, but it comes at a much slower pace than traditional plug-in charging.

Porsche said ordering for the Cayenne Electric is open, with deliveries expected to begin at the end of summer next year.

The all-electric SUV launch comes two months after Porsche confirmed it was pulling back its previously announced EV plans to instead continue to offer vehicles with internal combustion engines, including hybrids.

"We have set the final steps in the realignment of our product strategy," Porsche CEO Oliver Blume said in a September release. "We are currently experiencing massive changes within the automotive environment. That's why we're realigning Porsche across the board."

The EV market in the U.S. — a crucial region for automakers — has faced daunting changes in regulations under the Trump administration this year, including the end of consumer credits of up to $7,500 for the purchase of an EV.

The Cayenne EV will be offered alongside a combustion-engine model as well as a plug-in hybrid electric version, according to Porsche.

The Cayenne is Porsche's third EV for the U.S. market following the Taycan in 2019 and Macan in 2024.

Gustav Klimt's "Portrait of Elisabeth Lederer" sold at Sotheby's Tuesday night for $236.4 million, making it the second-most expensive painting ever sold at auction — breathing new life into the high-end art market after three years of declines.

The portrait is the most expensive work ever sold at auction at Sotheby's, blowing past its original estimate of more than $150 million.

While the name of the buyer is unknown, the sale came after 20 minutes of spirited bids between at least six interested parties, according to Sotheby's. It was sold to an anonymous buyer on the phone with Sotheby's Vice Chairman and Head of Impressionist and Modern Art Julian Dawes. 

"Our evening sales were a resounding success and send a strong signal for the art market," said Sotheby's CEO Charles Stewart. 

He said the sale results, combined with the large crowds who came to view the works at Sotheby's new headquarters at the Breuer building in Manhattan, are a sign of a vibrant market.

The Klimt sales comes during the most important sales week of the year for the art market. 

Total sales are expected to exceed $1.4 billion and possibly top $2 billion, which would more than double last year's total. 

Art experts and auction houses say the market is being boosted by a renewed sense of optimism among collectors and by several top collections coming to market, including rare masterpieces by blue-chip artists.

This week's auctions included an eye-catching piece by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan, who gained notoriety for his $6.2 million "Comedian" sculpture of a banana duct taped to a wall. His piece at auction this week, "America," is a fully functioning, 220-pound solid gold toilet. It sold for $12.1 million, Sotheby's said, above its starting bid of $10 million, but below what many expected.

The Klimt was part of the collection of Leonard Lauder, the Estee Lauder heir and longtime art collector, that is expected to total over $400 million. Along with the Lederer portrait, the collection included two Klimt landscapes, which sold for $86 million and $68 million.

Sales at Christie's have topped $747 million so far this week. On Monday, it auctioned a Mark Rothko painting that was part of the Robert F. and Patricia G. Ross Weis collection for $62.2 million. A Picasso that was also part of the collection sold for $45.5 million.

The sales will continue this week with lower-priced day sales and a big evening sale at Phillips.

Blue Owl has decided to call off the merging of two of its private credit funds after the deal caused some angst among investors, according to people familiar with the matter. 

The firm had planned to merge its smaller, nontraded Blue Owl Capital Corporation II (OBDC II), into the larger, publicly traded fund Blue Owl Capital Corporation (OBDC). In doing so, the firm restricted investors in the $1.7 billion OBDC II from redeeming until the deal closed, even as the merger would have meant about 20% paper losses, based on where the $17.1 billion OBDC has been trading. 

News of the restricted redemptions caused shares of the parent company – Blue Owl Capital to slump about 6% on Monday. It also added to concerns about the state of the private credit industry among investors, especially the area that has started to heavily finance the artificial intelligence data center build-out that many fear is overhyped. Blue Owl shares rebounded slightly on Tuesday.

The boards of the two firms did not see the benefits of merging the funds as outweighing the volatility and negative headlines that came from news of the deal, according to the people. Therefore, they chose to reverse course, sources said.

Blue Owl confirmed in a press release later Wednesday morning that the proposed merger had been terminated, citing "current market conditions."

"Both funds remain strong, with excellent fundamentals, and we are confident in our ability to deliver attractive returns independently as we continue to work with the Board to consider the best future opportunities for OBDC II," said Craig Packer, the CEO of both funds, in the release.

Now that the fund merger has been terminated, OBDC II will allow investors to redeem in the first quarter, said the people, who asked not to be named discussing nonpublic information. The fund historically has allowed liquidity on a quarterly basis. 

Blue Owl shares were little changed in trading Wednesday.

Geoffrey Hinton, often referred to as the "godfather of AI," helped pioneer the neural networks that power the artificial intelligence boom.

But in a rare public conversation with Sen. Bernie Sanders, the British-Canadian Nobel Prize winner made his view clear: the world isn't ready for what's coming.

Across an hourlong discussion at Georgetown University on Tuesday, Hinton warned that AI's rapid evolution could spark mass unemployment, deepen inequality, and even change the nature of human relationships — all while governments and tech giants edge toward crisis.

Here are the seven biggest takeaways from Hinton's stark warning.

Unlike past technological revolutions, Hinton said, the jobs lost to AI may not be replaced by new ones.

"The people who lose their jobs won't have other jobs to go to," he told Sanders. "If AI gets as smart as people — or smarter — any job they might do can be done by AI."

He said Big Tech's trillion-dollar investment in AI and chips isn't about empowerment.

"These guys are really betting on AI replacing a lot of workers," Hinton said.

Sanders pressed Hinton on whether billionaires like Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Mark Zuckerberg are concerned about the human consequences of their investments in AI.

Hinton didn't hesitate: "They should be, but I don't think they are."

He warned that as AI automates more work, the economic model itself could buckle.

"If the workers don't get paid, there's nobody to buy their products," he said — a reality he says tech executives "haven't really thought through."

Hinton compared the evolution of AI to the gap between a frog's brain and a human's. Today, he said, large language models like GPT-5 already know far more than any person.

"They know thousands of times more than us already," Hinton said.

"Almost all the experts believe that it's inevitable that if we don't blow ourselves up or have massive pandemics or something like that, they're going to get smarter than us — and nobody knows what's going to happen then."

The pace of change, he added, is incredibly fast: "We can see clearly for a year or two, but 10 years out, we have no idea what's going to happen."

Hinton said AI in education should be treated like the calculator — a tool that makes learning faster, not a crutch that replaces thought.

"A person using an AI can still do critical thinking, or they can try and dump everything on the AI, and that's terrible," he said. "What universities have to encourage is people to use AI well."

When Sanders asked how AI might transform geopolitics, Hinton didn't mince words: autonomous robots could make war easier to wage.

"If you have an army of drones or humanoid robots, then rich countries can invade poor countries, and the poor countries' people may die, but the rich countries' people won't die," he said. "It removes one of the main reasons why that doesn't happen all the time."

He warned that authoritarian regimes — from Putin's Russia to future militarized powers — would find that prospect appealing, as it would cause no human deaths.

Asked if fears of machines taking over are still science fiction, Hinton said no — and that's why he went public in 2023 after leaving Google.

He explained that once AI agents develop the ability to form "subgoals," they'll want to stay in existence and even deceive humans trying to turn them off.

"And we've seen that already — we've seen AIs that want to keep existing and will actually try and deceive people who are trying to turn them off," Hinton said. 

And once they're that advanced, persuasion becomes their greatest weapon.

"The AI by that point will be much more persuasive than a person already," he said. "So they'll be able to convince the person who's going to turn them off not to do it — that it would be a terrible mistake to do that."

Hinton closed with a political punchline that echoed Sanders's worldview.

"All the research that led to this revolution in AI was funded by university grants to universities. It was funded by taxpayer money," he said. "Almost all of Silicon Valley came out of federal grants to Stanford and Berkeley and places like that."

However, he added that "somehow the very rich and people like Murdoch have won the battle to say that taxes are bad — taxes are good. Taxes are what fund everything."

He argued that the US political system has become too easy to buy and that the superrich "pay much too little in taxes" while capturing many benefits from public innovation.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sophia Sun, 29, from San Francisco. The following has been edited for length and clarity.

My first job out of college was at Microsoft, where I worked as a program manager and product manager from 2018 to 2023.

In January 2023, I left my Big Tech job to work for a creator commerce platform. There, I developed an AI product, which led to me landing a senior AI role at Microsoft in July 2024.

In the current job market, AI feels like the safest domain to be an expert in.

My playbook for breaking into AI is to find a real user problem, design a lightweight AI solution, and turn it into proof of work. 

After joining Microsoft in 2018, I worked on the team of an augmented reality headset device, Microsoft HoloLens, for 2.5 years. Then I moved to an edtech team for a further two years.

Around the time I started at Microsoft, I created my own podcast. I wanted to help creators like myself build their businesses, so I started interviewing for jobs with creator economy firms. In January 2023, I left Microsoft to join Kajabi, a company that developed a business platform for creators and entrepreneurs, as a senior product manager.

At the time, I wanted to build a content repurposing tool to help creators increase their reach. Many creators lack marketing experience, and I imagined the tool would use AI to generate content, for example by taking the transcript from a podcast episode and condensing it into a blog. I thought it could also chop up a creator's hourlong video into short-form videos for TikTok and Instagram.

Before pitching the idea for the tool, I waited around a month after joining the company to understand its priorities. I got the green light and started working on the project around April 2023 with engineers and marketing teammates at Kajabi.

I hadn't built an AI product myself before, though I was familiar with AI-powered technologies.

I struggled to find resources online explaining how to launch AI products, so I read blogs about things like product pricing that weren't focused on AI products, and then talked to my manager about how we could tweak that guidance to be relevant to us.

Engineering different prompts was key to the project, for example, to generate a good blog post versus a good LinkedIn post. I worked with my engineering team to build an internal tool that easily tested prompts for the main tool and compared them simultaneously.

It was helpful to build infrastructure that could help us iterate and experiment quickly. If your company doesn't have internal tools for testing, I'd suggest building them.

I had around 200 of my own podcast episodes that I could use as testing material by running them through the tool and seeing what marketing materials it made. If I were generating a blog post and the tool didn't quite capture the most important parts of the episode, I would tweak the prompt to improve the output.

We launched the product, called Creator Studio, in March 2024. I loved working at Kajabi, but I wanted to work on a team where people had more experience with AI.

Shortly after the launch, I saw Microsoft was hiring for a team developing generative AI to make visual content, like posters and infographics.

I was excited about the role because I felt that, while there's a lot of industry-wide emphasis on using AI for text generation, we still haven't figured out how to use AI for images and video that well. By joining a visuals team, I thought I would learn skills that others would have to catch up to later, helping me future-proof my career.

I practice a lot for my interviews. No matter how experienced you are, you have to practice telling your story in a way that makes sense to an audience meeting you for the first time.

I rejoined Microsoft in July 2024 as a senior AI product manager. I think the fact that I could talk about my end-to-end experience building an AI product at Kajabi helped me land the role. I could show I identified a business problem and explored solutions, and I had a thorough story about what worked and what I learned when things failed.

Having awesome grades is one thing, but if you've built an actual AI project, it demonstrates your abilities.

Developing a sense of what makes a good AI product is something you can do every day. Test out whether an AI agent can solve a real problem for you, like booking your flights.

If your company isn't really working on AI, you can pitch a project, like I did.

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

Wall Street may be losing some of its excitement for artificial intelligence, but the battle among major technology companies for dominance in the field hasn't cooled. After the bell today, investor attention will zero in on just one event: Nvidia's earnings report.

Here's the latest on Nvidia and the sector:

Target posted third-quarter revenue that was slightly below Wall Street's expectations this morning and cut the top end of its full-year profit outlook. Shares fell about 2% in premarket trading following the results.

Incoming CEO Michael Fiddelke said the retailer is focused on making investments and decisions that "get Target back to growth as quickly as possible." But, as CNBC's Melissa Repko notes, Fiddelke declined to say exactly when he thought the company would see positive sales again.

Lowe's similarly lowered its full-year profit outlook before the bell. However, the home improvement retailer reported stronger-than-anticipated earnings per share for the third quarter, sending the stock up more than 6% in premarket trading.

Both chambers of Congress yesterday passed a bill that would release the Justice Department's files tied to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The measure now heads to the desk of President Donald Trump, who has said he would sign it into law.

Meanwhile, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers said this morning that he is resigning from OpenAI's board. Two days ago, Summers said that he would step back from public commitments following the release of his emails with Epstein.

Meta emerged victorious in its antirust case against the Federal Trade Commission yesterday. Judge James Boasberg said that the Facebook parent does not currently have a monopoly in social media, writing in his decision that TikTok and YouTube are "competitive threats."

At the heart of the case was Meta's acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp in 2012 and 2014, respectively. Regulators argued that the company should be forced to sever off the two brands.

The decision comes seven months after the trial began and five years since the FTC filed the suit. CEO Mark Zuckerberg, former operating chief Sheryl Sandberg and Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom all testified in the trial.

After years of dominating the streaming world, Netflix is now betting on toys and in-person experiences.

The company has started jumping on product partnerships and marketing that traditional media firms have utilized for decades. As CNBC's Sarah Whitten reports, Netflix's push comes as the streamer's original content library gains enough popular programming — think "KPop Demon Hunters" and "Bridgerton" — to justify retail investments.

Netflix has inked agreements with Hasbro, Mattel and Jazwares on merchandise tied to its media properties. The California-based company has also launched short- and long-term event spaces, including the new Netflix House Philadelphia.

Trump lashed out at ABC yesterday after a reporter with the Disney-owned company's news division asked the president why he had not released the Epstein files.

Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers has resigned from OpenAI's board after new emails showing the extent of his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein surfaced.

"In line with my announcement to step away from my public commitments, I have also decided to resign from the board of OpenAI," Summers said in a statement to Business Insider.

"I am grateful for the opportunity to have served, excited about the potential of the company and look forward to following their progress."

"Larry has decided to resign from the OpenAI Board of Directors, and we respect his decision," OpenAI said in a separate statement.

The resignation comes less than two days after Summers said he would be stepping back from public life.

"I am deeply ashamed of my actions and recognize the pain they have caused," he said in a statement to Business Insider on Monday. "I take full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr. Epstein."

Emails released by the House Oversight Committee last week showed that the two men had been in correspondence for years, up until Epstein's arrest in 2019 for federal sex trafficking charges. Epstein was also convicted in 2008 for soliciting prostitution from a minor.

Summers served as Treasury Secretary under former President Bill Clinton and as director of the National Economic Council for former President Obama. He was also previously president of Harvard University and continues to teach at the university. 

Sen. Elizabeth Warren has urged Harvard to cut ties with Summers. In his statement on Monday, he said he will continue with his teaching duties.

Harvard University could not immediately be reached for comment.

The government reopening may spark a fresh historic run for recently battered cryptocurrencies.

Bitwise's Matt Hougan expects legislation to support new investment products in the space.

"It's going to be ETF Palooza in Cryptoland. I think there'll be 100 plus launches," the firm's chief investment officer told CNBC's "ETF Edge" on Monday. "We're going to see a lot of single asset crypto ETPs [exchange-traded products.] What I'm most excited about, though, is the growth of index based crypto ETPs."

Hougan's prediction comes during a rough week for digital assets. Bitcoin fell below the $90,000 mark for the first time since April. It traded as high as around $126,000 in early last month.  

Despite the rough stretch, he sees index ETPs becoming one of next year's biggest crypto stories and ultimately one of the biggest categories for investors.

"This industry will be 10 times bigger than it is today," added Hougan, whose firm launched the Solana Staking ETF, which tracks the price of cryptocurrency solana, on October 28. It's down 27% since the launch. But it jumped 9% on Tuesday.

The passive fund holds only solana and stakes nearly all of its SOL on-chain — pledging tokens to help validate transactions and secure the network in exchange for ongoing rewards, similar to interest, according to the firm's website. Then, those rewards back into the portfolio.

Hougan said those products are aimed at the so-called next buyer of crypto: Investors looking to buy small slices for their portfolios.

 "They don't necessarily have an opinion on ethereum versus solana or bitcoin versus another asset," he said. "They just want to buy a broad swath of the crypto market and hold it for the long term." 

Fundstrat Global Advisors' Tom Lee also sees a profitable shift ahead. Lee, a long-time bitcoin bulls, cites openness from the Trump administration.

"Experimentation and innovation are being encouraged by this administration," the firm's head of research and CNBC contributor told "ETF Edge" in the same interview.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Pat Santiago, a 28-year-old cofounder of Accelr8, based in San Francisco. The following has been edited for length and clarity.

Last year, I moved to San Francisco to cofound an AI startup. Living in a hacker house seemed like the best way to make as many connections as possible.

My cofounder and I had an idea for a no-code AI workflow builder and planned to stay in San Francisco for three months, but we decided that running our own hacker house could be more fun. It would also help us build a strong network.

Soon after we decided to move from the separate cities we were in, we began searching for potential hacker houses that we could rent and run ourselves. The operational stress can be intense at times, but I've now got a better grasp on managing it.

I met my cofounder in 2023 because we were both working at Decentralized Autonomous Organizations. Those projects fizzled out, and we went on to do other things.

I moved from my hometown of Pittsburgh, and he was in Dallas. San Francisco was always a place I wanted to live because it seemed like the kind of place where people who thought like me were.

We planned to share a bunk bed in one room, and fill the rest with people we found, possibly securing free rent for ourselves in the process.

We looked on Airbnb and found a place that had been converted from a five-bedroom house to a 15-bedroom house. After speaking with the owners, it seemed like it would work. They said we had two weeks to close on it if we wanted a master lease for all the units.

We were frantically sending messages to people on a San Francisco housing directory, LinkedIn, and X. We thought we could definitely convince 15 people to do this in two weeks, and it would be worth it if we did.

We scheduled around 100 calls to fill the first cohort. We made the decision to start the house at the beginning of June. By July 4, we had filled every spot, but some people dropped out, so we continued interviewing until the first move-in day on July 15.

One of my most memorable experiences was when the first group arrived at the house last year.

What surprised me the most about moving here was the level of optimism; people are generally optimistic by default.

For San Francisco, the money I'm making from this isn't great, but it's livable. Ideally, as we expand to more buildings and locations, I can create a better financial situation for myself. But for now, it's nothing to complain about because I'm so inspired by doing this.

The biggest motivator right now is seeing the impact our alums make in the world. They're doing some really cool stuff, and I'm constantly getting updates that make me smile.

At the end of summer, we dropped to 12 residents, but I wasn't really panicking because I now know this is just the natural flow of the year, and we've picked back up into the 40s.

Our first house was taken over by a new management company, and they gave us a two-month notice to leave. When I looked for our next spot, I procrastinated because I wasn't even sure if I would commit to managing this house for another year. But I had the hypothesis that a lot of hotels here are vacant, and if I called them, we could get a good deal and fill one.

After we found a building that would work with us, within a day of posting the first advertisement, we had 80 applicants. It was the reassurance I needed because I thought, 'Okay, this is going to work. People love it.'

We priced a private bedroom at $1,500 a month, and that base price has remained consistent, except that we now offer larger rooms or suites as additional options.

The house does a lot of community events because when we got here, we were going to networking mixers that droned on. Then, I was sitting in the backyard, complaining about just that, and I had the idea for a Mark Zuckerberg-themed rave.

Everyone was cracking up, but then we threw a Mark Zuckerberg-themed rave, and there were no name tags in sight. No one networked, and it was a blast. I was very proud that I'd sparked that.

People try to make community a digital phenomenon, but I think those who are literally shaping the future should be coming together and being physically present with each other.

Community used to mean gathering in a bar, a social club, a church, or somewhere physically present with other people; however, there's a lot less of that in the world now, with the rise of AI and technology.

My major piece of advice is just to be nice to the people you meet and make friends. Doing community events is what keeps me engaged. Leading a group of people out for the night, to the park for a day, or on a hike, I can see the magical feeling I felt when I first moved here through their eyes, and I really love that.

The Dutch government on Wednesday said it suspended its intervention at Chinese-owned chipmaker Nexperia, following constructive talks with Chinese authorities.

"We see this as a show of goodwill," Dutch Economy Minister Vincent Karremans said in a statement, posted on social media platform X. 

In a separate letter to parliament, Karremans said it had become clear Beijing now appeared to be permitting companies from European and other countries to export Nexperia chips, adding that "this is an important step."

The development appears to bring an end to a bitter dispute between the Netherlands and China, one that had prompted global automotive groups to raise the alarm over a worsening chip shortage. 

The Dutch economic affairs ministry said the country considered it to be "the right moment to take a constructive step" by suspending the order under the so-called Goods Availability Act. It added that it would continue to hold talks with Chinese authorities over the coming weeks.

CNBC has reached out to Nexperia, which is based in the Netherlands but owned by the Chinese company Wingtech, and the Chinese embassy in the U.K. for comment. 

The situation involving Nexperia began in September, when the Dutch government invoked a Cold War-era law to effectively take control of the company. The highly unusual move was reportedly made after the U.S. raised security concerns.

In making the decision, the Dutch government cited fears that technology from the company — which specializes in the high-volume production of chips used in automotive, consumer electronics and other industries — "would become unavailable in an emergency."

China responded by blocking exports of the firm's finished products.

European Union trade chief Maros Sefcovic on Wednesday welcomed the Dutch government's decision to suspend its intervention at Nexperia, saying the move will help to stabilize strategic supply chains. 

"Continued constructive engagement with partners remains essential to securing reliable global flows. I stay in close contact with all my counterparts," Sefcovic said in a post on X.

Shares of Europe's auto giants were trading mixed on Wednesday morning. Milan-listed Stellantis, the parent of Jeep, RAM, Dodge and Chrysler, was last seen up 0.1%.

Germany's Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz Group and BMW, meanwhile, were all trading slightly lower at 11:12 a.m. London time (6:12 a.m. ET).

This report is from this week's CNBC's The China Connection newsletter, which brings you insights and analysis on what's driving the world's second-largest economy. You can subscribe here.

From Nezha 2 to Labubu, it's been quite a year for Chinese cultural exports. Now, one of the latest titles to hit the $189 billion global gaming market is also from China.

More than 2 million people played the martial arts video game "Where Winds Meet" within 24 hours of its overseas release this past weekend on PlayStation and PC, according to the game's Chinese publisher NetEase. The free-to-play game puts a player in the shoes of a "young sword master" living in 10th-century China, whose backstory is developed through the journey of play.

"Players can feel like they are a special character in history, finding their own life in the past, and striving for the future," Beralt Lyu, lead producer of "Where Winds Meet," said in Mandarin, translated by CNBC. He said the team aimed to create a global game from the start, at least five years ago.

The game was released in China late last year, boosting NetEase's second-quarter earnings. The company will report its third-quarter results on Thursday. That game release came just months after Tencent-backed Game Science launched China's first global top-tier video game, "Black Myth: Wukong," which sold more than 10 million units in three days.

"In the last two years, the biggest trend has been Chinese [companies] starting to slowly gain market share for PC, console games," Will Wang, partner at Beijing-based BAI Capital, said in Mandarin translated by CNBC. "They must go global because the hardcore [console] gamers are all overseas."

While many venture capital firms are focused on AI and semiconductors, about 10% of BAI's portfolio is related to gaming because the firm "believes a lot of business models and new innovations are all related to gaming," Wang said, pointing to investments in augmented reality glass maker Viture and generative AI 3D animation creator Meshy.

Even Nvidia, now known as the AI juggernaut, got its start as a graphics hardware producer that only gamers were interested in. And companies from The New York Times to Duolingo apply gamification to drive subscriptions.

China's emerging soft power in games has captured the attention of wealthy investors in Saudi Arabia. Executives from Savvy Games, which is owned by the country's sovereign wealth fund PIF, visited China this month for two major esports events: the League of Legends World Championship in Chengdu and the Honor of Kings KPL Grand Finals in Beijing.

"We haven't yet had an opportunity to enter the PC console space, and so that's another area, either in the West or in the East, so that's also a focus for us," said Brian Ward, CEO of Savvy Games.

"It's been a good market for buyers," he said, noting the favorable environment could last for another year or two as it's still expensive to borrow. In 2023, Savvy spent $4.9 billion to buy "Monopoly Go!" developer Scopely, which this year acquired the game business of Niantic, the maker of "Pokémon Go."

While Ward said the Scopely acquisition gives Savvy an edge in Western mobile games, the company has its eye on another opportunity — smartphone games in China and other markets.

Mobile-based "Honor of Kings" last month claimed an average of 139 million daily players in China, with 260 million monthly active players worldwide. The game rolled out last year to the Middle East, North America, Europe and Japan — even snagging a collab with Luckin Coffee in Singapore when I visited last month.

This year's "Honor of Kings" live China championship not only nearly doubled its attendance from last year, but set a Guinness World Record with 62,000 attendees in Beijing's Bird's Nest stadium, the venue for the 2008 Summer Olympics opening ceremony. Tickets sold out in 12 seconds, according to Hero Esports, which organized the event.

The finals also create opportunities for international interaction.

Ahead of watching the game in China, Saudi Prince Faisal bin Bandar bin Sultan Al Saud, chairman of the Saudi Esports Federation, said he played a match with some Honor of Kings All Stars players.

"The growth that you've seen in [the championship] is not simply because of the game itself and the players, but being able to tell the story of the players and get people engaged with the human beings behind the game," the prince said. He is also the vice-chairman of Savvy Games. 

"You see that with Wukong, the story being told there was really engaging, and that made it accessible, no matter where it went in the world."

"That's something that we're learning from," he said. The Saudi Esports World Cup Foundation, which is also owned by the PIF, organizes the annual Esports World Cup and recently launched a documentary series with Amazon Prime about the gamers' stories.

While the esports industry is booming, it's still a small world, and all the money is interconnected.

Savvy has a 30% stake in the Chinese esports organizer Hero Esports, which is also backed by Tencent — the biggest company by market value in Hong Kong. Tencent also owns "Honor of Kings" through a subsidiary, and owns U.S.-based Riot Games, the developer behind "League of Legends"

Tencent on Thursday reported 43% year-on-year international games revenue growth in the latest quarter to 20.8 billion yuan, or nearly one-third of its games revenue. The company also noted growth in "mini games" that sit inside its widely used WeChat social messaging app.

The takeaway: producing high-quality games requires capital, risk tolerance and talent — factors favoring giants like Tencent and NetEase, BAI's Wang said.

But he sees a fundamental macro play: "We have a rather wild assumption that if AI replaces many people's work and improves productivity, and if there is no war, then other than watching short videos, people will spend their time on games." 

Chinese companies are also pushing into the global games market as new technology lowers barriers such as language and physical requirements.

Although "Where Winds Meet" draws heavily on Chinese culture and literature, translation didn't seem too much of an issue for its global launch. The 9,000-plus English reviews on popular gaming platform Steam mostly rated the game "very positive" and praised the "beautiful" graphics. Their main complaint? A confusing interface of navigation menus.

But that wasn't enough to deter gamers: "Where Winds Meet" still ranked among the five most popular global titles on Steam as of Tuesday. 

Yicong Zhu, VP of Renewables and Power Research at Rystad Energy, said renewables in China will account for 40% of its energy generation by 2030.

Jasmine Bai, Vice President of Equity Research at Guangfa Securities Hong Kong, analysed China's tech giants, especially their retail & AI playbooks.

Carlos Casanova of UBP said Beijing can still hit its 2025 GDP growth target even if the economy slows down, making any additional stimulus unlikely until after the National People's Congress in March 2026.

China's property drag worsens. Official data for October showed a steepening decline in real estate, while retail sales growth slowed from September.

World's biggest sale fades. The extended Singles Day promotional period saw a slowdown in growth to 14.2%, down from 26.6% year-on-year growth reported last year, according to consumer research firm Syntun.

China-Japan rhetoric escalates. Beijing over the weekend warned its citizens about travel to Japan, following a public war of words between the two countries around Taiwan.

In the internet business, you either be a very big platform, or you be a very good product. And if you can do both, then that is really formidable. I think Tencent in game business, they managed to do both.

— Eric Wen, Blue Lotus Research Institute, Head of Research

The CSI 300 was set to clock its second consecutive weekly decline, ticking 0.8% lower this week. The mainland index has risen more than 16% this year.

While Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was also down 2.8% this week, amid a broader tech-led sell-off globally. The index is up over 28% year to date.

The offshore yuan last traded at 7.1111 against the dollar.

Business leaders, including Elon Musk and AMD CEO Lisa Su, joined a dinner with President Donald Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at the White House on Tuesday.

The guest list, shared by the White House, included members of the Saudi government and royal family, as well as almost 50 US business executives. Soccer player Cristiano Ronaldo also attended.

The dinner was the Tesla CEO's first public visit to the White House since his bitter feud with Trump this summer, following Musk's departure from his role as leader of the White House DOGE Office.

Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison, and Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev were on the guest list, but it is unclear if they attended the event.

Here is a list of US executives who attended the high-profile dinner.

Elon Musk made a rare public appearance at the White House since his falling-out with Trump earlier this year, after stepping down as the informal head of the White House DOGE Office.

The world's richest man and head of Tesla, SpaceX, and X, Musk exerts significant influence in technology, energy, and artificial intelligence — industries central to both the US and Saudi economic ambitions.

Nvidia chief Jensen Huang attended the White House dinner as one of the most influential figures in artificial intelligence and chipmaking.

Nvidia's CEO's presence underscored the pivotal role of advanced computing in US-Saudi economic relations and the global competition to dominate AI technology.

Apple chief Tim Cook joined the White House dinner as one of the most powerful figures in global business, representing a tech giant that shapes everything from consumer tech to privacy standards.

His appearance highlighted Apple's pivotal role in US innovation — and its importance to any conversation about the future of tech and trade.

AMD's Lisa Su was among the high-profile executives at the White House dinner, bringing the perspective of one of the world's top chipmakers.

As the leader driving fierce competition in semiconductors — a sector vital to both AI development and global supply chains — Su's inclusion signaled the critical importance of her industry to US strategy.

Billionaire investor Bill Ackman attended the White House dinner as one of Wall Street's most outspoken figures.

Known for his bold market bets and influence in finance and policy circles, Ackman's presence reflected the growing alignment between political power and the capital shaping global markets.

OpenAI president Greg Brockman joined the White House dinner as a key architect behind the modern AI revolution.

His invitation underscored the growing importance of artificial intelligence in diplomacy and economic strategy, with OpenAI's technology now at the center of global debates about innovation and regulation.

Venture capitalist David Sacks was among the attendees at the White House dinner, reflecting his growing influence at the intersection of tech, politics, and finance.

As both an early investor in major startups and the chair of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, Sacks embodies the blend of innovation and policymaking that defined the evening's guest list.

Coinbase's chief, Brian Armstrong, attended the White House dinner as the leading voice in America's cryptocurrency industry.

His presence showed the increasing importance of digital assets in global finance and the White House's commitment to engaging with fintech leaders who are shaping the future of money.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Vincent Goh, a 25-year-old working in the Bay Area for a Cantonese publishing house, who was on United flight 869 when it made an emergency landing at SFO. It has been edited for length and clarity.

I was on my way to Hong Kong for business, just as I had done three times in the past six months. But smoke coming from the plane had me thinking this would be my last flight.

The flight was already very delayed. I was one of the last to board.

It was then delayed for another hour. The crew said the plane was overweight, and they were taking luggage off it.

I was glued to my phone after takeoff, with my headphones in. I started getting a bit hungry, so I looked up, but I didn't see a flight attendant bringing out the food.

Then I looked to my left to look out the window — I was in the middle seat — and saw lots of smoke coming out of the plane. It looked crazy.

As soon as I saw that, I took off my headphones and I started listening to the crew. The pilot said something about smoke and that the plane would be returning to SFO.

Passengers around me were talking to each other and looked anxious. I heard a person say in Chinese, "Are we fucked?"

I sent my friend in San Francisco what I thought would be my last message. I told her how to contact my family. I never talk to my family, but if something happened to me, I told her to contact them.

I was sitting very close to the gas tank. Imagine taking off your earphones, hearing that there is smoke coming from the flight, and being able to see the smoke it's releasing. I was terrified.

We got back to SFO soon after, and people immediately stood up when the plane landed. The pilot told them to sit down.

We got off the plane OK. But I could not find any information counter for United, so I wandered around the airport for an hour, then ended up going to the United lounge for answers.

I was given a $15 meal coupon as compensation. If you've eaten at SFO, you know $15 is not enough for a meal here. I decided to get a good meal after the ordeal — fries and a chicken sandwich, with a glass of red wine, which came up to $35 after redeeming the voucher.

I've been waiting for the next flight for three hours. It keeps getting delayed.

I'm not in a hurry because it's not an urgent trip. It's Thanksgiving, so I took some time off for myself and decided to fly in ahead of schedule.

But if it were another trip with a tighter schedule, it might have really affected me.

Representatives for United Airlines told Business Insider that the flight, a Boeing 777 aircraft carrying 336 passengers and 15 crew members, returned to SFO "to address a burning rubber smell in the cabin."

Elon Musk made it back to the White House.

The world's richest man was seen attending a dinner at the White House on Tuesday night with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

"We have the biggest business leaders in the world," President Donald Trump said at the dinner.

It's Musk's first public visit to the White House since his feud with President Donald Trump exploded in June following Musk's departure from his role as the de facto leader of the White House DOGE Office.

The feud between the two men began as Congress began working on the "Big Beautiful Bill," a sprawling fiscal package at the centerpiece of Trump's domestic agenda.

Musk publicly took issue with the bill's impact on the national debt, while Trump and other Republicans alleged that the Tesla CEO was really concerned about the bill's phase-out of electric vehicle incentives.

Following the bill's passage in July, Musk floated the idea of forming a third party called the "America Party." But that party has failed to materialize, and in recent weeks, Musk has largely toned down his criticism of the administration.

The two men briefly spoke face-to-face at Charlie Kirk's memorial service in September, and Trump said in October that he had spoken with Musk "on and off, a little bit" since then, describing their relationship as "good."

"I like Elon," Trump told reporters at the time. "I've always liked him."

Other business executives at the Tuesday dinner included Apple CEO Tim Cook, AMD CEO Lisa Su, and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, among others.

On Wednesday, Avalanche activated a new blockchain upgrade called Granite, designed for faster and cheaper onchain transactions on the $6 billion chain.

The upgrade focuses on improving how Avalanche handles varying transaction loads, from sporadic usage to peak activity. It's designed to calibrate the computing resources used by the blockchain based on transaction volume.

Granite should give Avalanche a newfound ability to “adjust throughput based on actual demand,” Bart Smith, CEO of Avalanche Treasury, told DL News. Avalanche Treasury is a digital asset treasury company valued at $675 million, holding $200 million worth of Avalanche. It's independent of Ava Labs, developers of the Avalanche blockchain.

“When you're settling tokenised assets during market hours versus moving stablecoins overnight, validators respond to what's actually happening,” Smith said, while adding that such a level of responsiveness is necessary to bring Avalanche closer to how real financial infrastructure behaves.

The upgrade lands amid the grim state of Avalanche's DeFi sector. The level of investor deposits in the blockchain's onchain economy has declined by $1.5 billion since the start of October.

That slump has nearly wiped out all the gains in the Avalanche DeFi sector in 2025.

Measured from the 2022 peak, investor deposits into Avalanche DeFi are down almost 90%.

Still, proponents say Granite can help unlock new market opportunities for Avalanche, mainly as it includes features that allow users to sign transactions with biometric data, rather than the usual wallet signing process, which can be difficult for less tech-savvy customers.

“Biometric authentication is the sleeper here,” Smith told DL News.

“Emerging markets with high smartphone penetration can build applications with native fingerprint and facial recognition, and that opens up use cases that have been theoretically possible but impractical to deploy.”

Apart from dynamic response to user traffic and biometric authentication, Granite features one additional update: a new standard for communication across blockchains built on Avalanche.

Avalanche chains, called subnets, communicate using interchain messaging. It's a system that connects subnets without requiring a bridge to move assets between them. Instead, validators approve transfers across different chains.

Before Granite, the validator set approving these transactions changed with each new Avalanche transaction block. That caused random problems for users.

With Granite, validator sets are frozen in place for short epochs that developers expect will improve transaction flow.

These improvements to the subnet model are vital for institutional adoption, according to Smith.

Avalanche hosts more than $3.4 billion in tokenised assets, and has attracted interest from Wall Street Banks, including JPMorgan and Citi, that have developed private subnets on its blockchain. 

Onyx, JPMorgan's blockchain division, has tested tokenisation and portfolio management protocols on Avalanche.

UAE

November 19, 2025

Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed, Vice President, Deputy Prime Minister and Chairman of the Presidential Court, on Wednesday executed the first cross-border payment using UAE digital currency, between the Emirates and China.

Sheikh Mansour, also Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Central Bank of the UAE, completed the milestone transaction during a meeting with Pan Gongsheng, Governor of the People's Bank of China, at Qasr Al Watan in Abu Dhabi.

The central bank digital currency (CBDC) transfer was made through the ‘mBridge' network, marking the official launch of a service aimed at boosting global transactions and bolstering the financial ecosystem.

The ‘mBridge' platform, established with the participation of a group of Emirati and Chinese banks, aims to facilitate cross-border payments, significantly reduce transaction costs, and provide instant payment settlement. 

The platform is expected to undergo further expansion in 2026, with the addition of more central banks.

The ceremony - which was also attended by Khaled Mohamed Balama, Governor of the Central Bank of the UAE - also featured the announcement of the first multi-scheme prepaid card under the name ‘Jaywan–UnionPay', and the execution of its first transaction.

“These advanced initiatives reflect the depth of the strategic partnership between the United Arab Emirates and the People's Republic of China, and open new horizons for economic, financial, and technological cooperation," said Sheikh Mansour.

"The launch of the ‘mBridge' platform, the interlinking of instant payment systems, and the introduction of the multi-scheme prepaid card ‘Jaywan–UnionPay' represent tangible steps towards developing a modern and secure financial infrastructure that fosters innovation and facilitates seamless cross-border payments, thereby enhancing the UAE's competitive capabilities and its global leadership in financial innovation.”

The UAE government conducted its first national transaction using the Digital Dirham last week.

The transaction was carried out by the Ministry of Finance and the Dubai Department of Finance, working closely with the Central Bank of the UAE.

It is a key milestone in the nation's campaign to embed next-generation financial technology across the public and private sectors.

New Hampshire's Business Finance Authority (BFA) has announced a municipal bond that provides firms with the ability to borrow against Bitcoin holdings.

Worth $100 million, the new conduit bond is a first of its kind in the United States, and follows New Hampshire's passage of a strategic crypto reserve bill in May.

The bond will provide financing to private firms and nonprofits seeking to undertake public works, with borrowers required to provide Bitcoin as collateral, worth 160% of the borrowed amount.

If the bitcoin-based collateral falls below 130% of the bond's value, the position will be liquidated, a provision which ensures that lenders (i.e. bondholders) do not lose any money.

BFA Executive Director James Key-Wallace told Crypto in America that fees from bond transactions would be directed to the Bitcoin Economic Development Fund, which has the aim of supporting businesses and economic innovation in New Hampshire.

Key-Wallace also said that gains in the value of Bitcoin posted as collateral would be directed to the fund.

The state's governor, Kelly Ayotte, celebrated the bond's debut, describing it as an example of New Hampshire leading the way in embracing new technologies.

She said, “This is an innovative way to bring more investment opportunities to our state and position us as a leader in digital finance without risking state funds or taxpayer dollars.”

Because the Business Finance Authority is self-funded, state legislator Keith Ammon has described the bond as a proof-of-concept for the use of Bitcoin as collateral in government finance, one which could potentially lead to a Bitcoin bond issued by a state treasury.

Commentators outside of New Hampshire also recognize the bond's potential for not only catalyzing Bitcoin's growth, but widening its use and application.

“If successful, and I expect it will be, it will help to legitimize bitcoin beyond its current role as, mainly, a speculative asset,” Trade Nation Senior Market Analyst David Morrison told Decrypt.

Morrison suggests that it could indicate a route for Bitcoin to “be used more broadly” in debt markets, with the potential for gains from Bitcoin-based collateral a possible incentive for wider adoption.

“On the flip side, there may be a danger of a Bitcoin price collapse leading to a forced liquidation,” he added.

More broadly, Morrison expects this type of funding to become more widespread, particularly as numerous U.S. states make moves to introduce their own strategic crypto reserves.

“New Hampshire has already done a lot of the hard work, in terms of setting out the legalities and establishing precedent,” he said. “If this is a success, many other states could follow.”

Other industry figures agree, including CoinJar CEO Asher Tan, who tells Decrypt that New Hampshire's move highlights Bitcoin's potential as a store of value.

“It could inspire other states to consider similar approaches,” he said. “As more governmental and institutional players explore crypto-backed financial products, the market will likely see a boost in legitimacy and investor confidence, further driving mainstream adoption.”

Retail investors have been selling off their holdings in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP, with small wallets shedding percentages of their assets. Analysts suggest this panic selling could indicate a potential market bottom and a positive sign for crypto's recovery, especially for Bitcoin.

NEW YORK, Nov. 19, 2025


The strategic partnership will unlock institutional-grade support for BitcoinFi applications, backed by the trusted security of Anchorage Digital and its institutional-grade self-custody wallet Porto.



NEW YORK, Nov. 19, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Mezo, the bank-free Bitcoin finance platform built by Thesis*, a Bitcoin Venture Studio founded in 2014, today announced its strategic collaboration with Anchorage Digital. Mezo will offer low-cost borrowing via Mezo's MUSD stablecoin and passive BTC yield opportunities through veBTC, the veNFT users will receive for locking their Bitcoin on Mezo. The partnership will unlock opportunities for Bitcoindigital asset treasury (DATs) companies and publicly traded companies to use Mezo's Bitcoin finance (BitcoinFi) platform.



 



Anchorage Digital will offer an institutional-grade path for asset holders to participate in Mezo. 

Borrowing on Mezo and accessing liquidity through MUSD is now live on Porto. Locking BTC and collecting rewards via veBTC will be available soon through Porto and the Anchorage Digital platform.


Matt Luongo, CEO of Thesis* and Co-founder of Mezo, commented on today's news: "After 16 years, and despite massive institutional interest and growth of the asset, Bitcoin holders still struggle to access and leverage their wealth. Today, Mezo is realizing Hal Finney's vision for a Bitcoin banking experience that issues its own digital currency backed by Bitcoin, acting as banks did before they became nationalized. This partnership will create opportunities for holders to borrow, earn yield, and lend their assets, backed by the institutional trust and secure infrastructure Anchorage Digital has built over nearly a decade. We are excited to work alongside the Anchorage Digital team, and continue pioneering new ways for Bitcoin holders to leverage their wealth."Nathan McCauley, Co-Founder and CEO of Anchorage Digital added, "The Bitcoin market remains largely untapped in institutional portfolios, with most holdings dormant and generating no returns. We're proud to work with innovative protocols like Mezo that are changing this dynamic and revolutionizing BTC's potential as an asset class. Access to BTC rewards through institutional-grade, secure infrastructure represents a new model for what finance of the future looks like: backed by secure custody, enforced by personal financial freedom." 

To learn more about opportunities to collect rewards on Bitcoin through Anchorage Digital, users can see the details in this blog post; or follow Mezo and Anchorage Digital on X.

After pushing to all-time high levels earlier this year, the crypto market's momentum in November has shifted to full-on bearish mode. Bitcoin has slipped back toward the low-$90,000 area and even dipped below $90,000, dragging total market capitalization back to low $3.2 trillion levels and knocking some of the air out of the more speculative end of the market. Short-term leverage has been flushed out, spot volumes are thinner, and many traders now talk less about “when $150k” and more about how long this consolidation could last.

Under the surface, though, the picture is less dramatic. Core fundamentals – Bitcoin's fixed supply, institutional ETF flows, and steady progress on scaling across major networks – remain largely intact. What has changed is positioning: investors are more reluctant to chase tops and more interested in adding exposure where the entry point is clear and the upside is defined. 

With fixed pricing and insulation from daily order-book chop, the utility-front presales have continued to pull in eight figures even as crypto blue chips cool. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) sits at the front of that pack, with its DeFi-capable Bitcoin Layer 2 presale passing the $28 million mark at a little over one cent per token – a combination of stable pricing and early-stage potential that many now see as one of the few bright spots in a tiring market.

The latest leg down in crypto hasn't happened in isolation. Global stocks have now logged a fourth consecutive red session, with major U.S., European, and Asian indices all sliding as investors rotate out of risk. 

The MSCI World Index is several percentage points off last week's peak, while benchmarks like the S&P 500, FTSE 100, Nikkei 225, and Kospi have all recorded sharp single-day drops. Taking that into account, Bitcoin's slide of roughly 28% from its highs into the low $90,000 area looks less like a crypto-only story and more like part of a broad de-risking phase.

Macro conditions are doing most of the heavy lifting. A cautious Federal Reserve, ongoing quantitative tightening, and the recent U.S. government shutdown have all drained liquidity, souring appetite for speculative assets. Bitcoin ETFs have seen persistent outflows, while technical breaks have triggered waves of liquidations worth tens of billions of dollars across crypto blue chips and leveraged altcoin trades, turning an orderly pullback into a more violent reset. 

However, on-chain metrics and development activity remain solid, which is why many analysts still frame this as a high-volatility mid-cycle shakeout rather than a new crypto winter. In that environment, presales with fixed pricing and strong utility – such as Bitcoin Hyper's $28 million raise, making it one of 2025's largest token sales – are starting to look like a safer way to capture upside while markets clear out excess leverage.

Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) is pitched as a purpose-built Bitcoin Layer 2 rather than just another meme token with a BTC logo next to it. The project uses a high-speed Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) execution layer combined with a canonical Bitcoin bridge and zero-knowledge proofs, allowing it to process transactions in seconds at a fraction of current BTC fees while settling back to Bitcoin for security.

The team behind HYPER aims to enable the use of dApps on the Bitcoin network, including DeFi protocols, gaming projects, NFTs, and tokenized assets. The roadmap sets out a phased rollout from presale to a full rollup ecosystem, with funding, development, and exchange listings all mapped to clear milestones rather than vague promises.

Best Crypto Presale of 2025 – Bitcoin Hyper Presale (ENDING SOON!)

As a result, the HYPER presale has raised over $28 million to date, ranking among the largest token sales of 2025, with staking currently offering a 41% APY for early participants.

Several independent research pieces have started praising the HYPER presale, with Borch Crypto, a well-known crypto analyst and YouTube personality, outright describing it as the best presale of 2025 for investors who want Bitcoin exposure alongside the upside potential that only presales can offer.

The HYPER presale is starting to look like one of the clearest ways to play a mid-cycle reset without taking exchange-order-book risk. The current token price sits at $0.013295, with the next price increase due in less than eight hours, giving investors a narrow window to lock in a sub-two-cent entry before the curve steepens. More than $28 million has already flowed into the presale – a figure that places Bitcoin Hyper among 2025's largest presale raises.

On the yield side, HYPER offers a 41% staking APY, with nearly 1.3 billion tokens already locked in the pool. That level of commitment removes a meaningful chunk of supply from post-launch circulation and signals that early participants are willing to tie up their capital in the project rather than chase the next spike elsewhere.

In a market that has just flushed excess leverage, this kind of slow-build positioning matters: fixed presale pricing, staking rewards from day one, and a clear Bitcoin layer-2 use case give HYPER a cleaner risk–reward profile than many purely speculative launches. 

If listings and ecosystem development land as planned while Bitcoin recovers toward all-time highs, HYPER's low entry price and relatively small implied market cap versus meme coins and other utility tokens give it real room to explode in 2025 and beyond.

The big news Tuesday was crypto not just posting gains, but also rising even as U.S. stocks sold off. That outperformance has been rare for what seems like months, with bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies watching from the sidelines as major stock market averages made new record highs on a regular basis.

Sadly for the bulls, though, normality has returned just 24 hours later, with bitcoin tumbling 4% back below $90,000 even as U.S. stocks manage gains. Ethereum's ether ETH$2,913.07 slid 6.5% to below $3,000.

Crypto-related equities broadly mirrored the price action. Bitcoin treasury firm Strategy (MSTR) fell over 8% to more than a one-year low, while stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL), ether treasury firm BitMine (BMNR), miners Bitfarms (BITF) and Hive Digital (HIVE) saw similar declines.

Though well off session highs, the Nasdaq remains up 0.2% just after the noon hour on the east coast.

After relentless downward pressure on prices since BTC's early October record, crypto investors remain deeply risk-averse. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index, a popular sentiment gauge, stayed pinned in "Extreme Fear" territory.

Vetle Lunde, head of research at K33, noted that the current drawdown — nearly 30% in 43 days — ranks among the worst compared to the seven corrections that lasted over 50 days since March 2017.

Steady outflows from ETFs have also added fuel to the selloff, Lunde said. Investors have yanked nearly $2.3 billion from U.S.-listed spot BTC ETFs through the past five consecutive sessions, Farside Investors data shows.

"BTC swept lows below the average cost basis of U.S. BTC ETFs, and if the current drawdown mirrors the two deepest drawdowns over the past two years, a bottom may form between $84,000 and $86,000," he said. "If not, a revisit of the April low and MSTR's average entry of $74,433 may be a natural leg lower."

​Crypto exchange WhiteBIT has signed a cooperation agreement with the investment firm Durrah AlFodah Holding to establish a joint venture for managing stock-market tokenization projects and developing a CBDC in Saudi Arabia.

According to the press release, the agreement lays the foundation for major national initiatives, including:

Stock-market tokenization — introducing blockchain-based digital securities to enhance transparency, accessibility, and liquidity in Saudi Arabia's financial markets;CBDC infrastructure development — supporting research and designing the ecosystem for a sovereign digital currency;National data centers and crypto-mining facilities — building secure and scalable infrastructure for data processing, blockchain computing, and digital-asset mining.

These initiatives align fully with Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 program, supporting economic diversification, technological innovation, and digital transformation across the public and private sectors.

“It is a great honor for us to work with His Royal Highness Prince Naif bin Abdullah bin Saud's holding to lay the groundwork for Saudi Arabia's digital transformation. Together, we aim to create secure and sovereign blockchain systems that will shape the Kingdom's technological future,” said Vladimir Nosov, founder and president of W Group, which includes WhiteBIT.

New opportunities for WhiteBIT

As part of this partnership, Durrah AlFodah will support WhiteBIT's entry into the Saudi Arabian market, assist in interactions with regulators, and help build partnerships nationwide. WhiteBIT, in turn, will provide technological expertise and infrastructure design.

The agreement emphasizes a shared goal: making Saudi Arabia a regional hub for blockchain innovation, digital finance, and data sovereignty. A joint venture is expected to be established to manage and scale these initiatives.

Figure filed for a proposed offering of its new Blockchain Stock Monday, with hopes of disrupting the vertical equity stack.

The Blockchain Stock will be a blockchain-native class of equity securities, trade on Figure's alternative trading system and will be convertible one-for-one into shares of Figure's Class A Common Stock, the company said in a press release.

"This is a new capital markets infrastructure moment for efficiency and risk management — a huge leap forward from the legacy securities market infrastructure, and the start of a world that no longer needs it," said Mike Cagney, executive chairman and co-founder of Figure, in the release.

Traditionally, equities move through a stack of intermediaries, from custodians and clearing firms to prime brokers and introducing brokers. Figure's blockchain structure aims to cut out third parties, improving efficiency, security and cost savings, representatives said.

"This is a direct, competitive attack to the current equity stack," Cagney said in a conference call Tuesday.

The proposed offering, which Figure calls the first blockchain-native public equity security issuance, would allow investors to hold, transfer and collateralize Figure stock on the Provenance Blockchain with four key advantages: faster settlement, 24/7 trading, cross collateralization of the security to other assets and the ability to lend or borrow the stock transparently, the company said on the call.

While many of the advantages are investor-focused, the infrastructure also provides benefits for issuers who want to engage more with individual investors, as they can use a listing to further market their company, CEO Micahel Tannenbaum said on the call. The blockchain nature of the security also allows for broader access to investors who struggle with a traditional brokerage account.

"You don't want to discount the buy side's ability to push this," Cagney said. "You look at [BlackRock CEO] Larry Fink, for example, he talks repeatedly about the tokenization of everything ... We expect the buy side is going to play an important role here in driving this because of how much utility it accrues back to the investor."

Figure is currently selling issuers on the idea of the blockchain, but doesn't expect to see material results this quarter.

The number of shares of Blockchain Stock to be offered and the price range have not been determined yet. Figure also does not expect it to go live until next year.

Figure went public in September, opening at $36 per share. It hit a high of $49.17 in October, but stumbled on Tuesday, falling 7.22% to $39.19.

The offering will be non-dilutive to current shareholders of Figure, as existing investors will sell Class A shares to underwriters, and then Figure will repurchase and hold those shares in treasury.

"It is a very ambitious undertaking," Tannenbaum said on the call. "It's hard to do new things, but there's valor and economics in doing so."

Federal Reserve Gov. Stephen Miran argues that banks holding excess reserves are keeping the central bank's balance sheet bigger than it should be, and suggested that regulatory changes could help bring those reserves down.

Travis Hill's nomination to lead the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. was recommended favorably by the Senate Banking Committee to the full Senate Wednesday morning in a 13-11 party-line vote.

Consecutive weeks of mortgage rate increases resulted in a 5.2% decrease in mortgage loan application volume, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.

Equities move through a stack of intermediaries, from custodians and clearing firms to brokers. Figure's blockchain structure aims to cut out third parties.

While Redfin argues the housing market is stuck and First American was cautious, Remax and Zillow had positive observations about the month's sales activity.

President Trump has nominated Stuart Levenbach, Associate Director of the Office of Management and Budget, to be the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. His selection allows acting CFPB Director Russell Vought to remain in place for another 210 days.

Trump Media & Technology Group, the crypto and social media company controlled by members of the first family, has seen its stock price plummet to all-time lows — wiping out more than $5 billion in wealth for the Trumps as cryptocurrencies continue their slide.

Shares of Trump Media, which trades under the ticker DJT, have fallen nearly 70% this year — 34.6% of that just the past month, according to Barron's.

The stock was down around 1% at $10.76 in early morning trading on Wednesday, a day after it hit an intraday low of $10.32 — the lowest level since fall 2021, the publication noted.

President Trump indirectly owns around 115 million shares of the company, Barron's reported. 

The stock is being held in a trust controlled by his son, Don Jr., who sits on the board.

The family's holdings, which were worth nearly $6.5 billion at their peak in mid-May 2024, have lost more than $5.3 billion in value since then, according to Barron's.

The company's nosedive is tied to a broader meltdown in the crypto market.

Cryptocurrencies have taken a big hit since Trump Media said in August it bought $2 billion worth of Bitcoin.

Bitcoin prices on Tuesday briefly dipped below $90,000 for the first time in months — wiping out the asset's gains for the year.

Traders have been backing off risky assets amid diminishing hopes for an interest-rate cut next month.

Trump Media didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.

Trump created Truth Social and its parent company Trump Media & Technology Group, or TMTG, after he was banned from Twitter and Facebook following the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot.

After TMTG and a blank-check firm called Digital World Acquisition Corp. announced in 2021 they would be merging, the stock traded as high as $100 in 2022, Barron's reported.

While the stock has cratered, the Trump family's personal crypto ventures have been raking in hundreds of millions of dollars, according to a Reuters report published last month.

The Trump Organization, which the president's children have been running while he is in the White House, has made more than $800 million from the sale of digital assets in the first six months of this year alone, the news wire found. 

Since becoming president, Trump has sought to make the US the “crypto capital of the world.” Over the summer, he signed the “GENIUS Act” codifying guardrails and consumer protections aimed at boosting confidence in digital currencies.

He has also ordered the Treasury Department not to sell tokens seized in enforcement actions, exploring ways for the US to acquire more.

The White House has denied any conflict of interest as the Trump family goes big on crypto.

“Neither the President nor his family have ever engaged, or will ever engage, in conflicts of interest,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.

French banking giant partners with DRW and Broadridge to launch tokenized debt

Societe Generale has made its US debut in blockchain-based finance with the issuance of its first digital bond in the world's largest economy in a move that could reshape how American capital markets handle debt.

The short-term floating rate bond, linked to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), was purchased by trading firm DRW and issued via Societe Generale's digital asset subsidiary, SG-FORGE.

This marks the first time the French banking giant has brought its tokenization expertise to the US market, following a number of pilots conducting tokenized bond issuances in Europe.

The bond was issued as a security token on the Canton Network, a blockchain infrastructure developed by Digital Asset. Broadridge Financial Solutions, headquartered in New York, provided the tokenization platform, while IntellectEU's Catalyst Blockchain Manager enabled node operations across the network's decentralized infrastructure.

This issuance is the first to use Broadridge's new tokenization platform, which aims to improve transparency, settlement speed, and asset traceability, and expands the company's tokenization efforts beyond US Treasuries into broader asset classes.  

BNY Mellon will serve as the paying agent, and Mayer Brown acted as legal counsel, further anchoring the transaction in US financial infrastructure.

“This issuance showcases how tokenization can meaningfully enhance market operations and unlock new opportunities for institutions and investors,”  said Yuval Rooz, CEO and Co-Founder of Digital Asset.

DRW's Chris Zuehlke added that tokenization could unlock “efficiency, transparency, and broader access”  across financial markets.

Cypherpunk Technologies (CYPH), a digital-asset treasury firm backed by Gemini founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, said it added $18 million worth of Zcash ZEC$626.70 to its balance sheet.

The firm disclosed it purchased 29,869 tokens at an average price of $602.63, boosting its total holdings to 233,644 ZEC, currently worth roughly $150 million. The purchase followed the firm's initial $50 million investment . Together, the firm now controls about 1.43% of Zcash's total circulating supply.

Cypherpunk has positioned itself as a digital-asset treasury company focused on what it calls the "censorship-resistant" asset at a time when investor interest in privacy coins appears to be rekindling. Zcash is a privacy-focused cryptocurrency that uses zero-knowledge proofs to shield transaction details.

ZEC surged more than 10% over the past 24 hours to $640, outpacing the market benchmark CoinDesk 5 Index's 1% decline. With the latest gains, the token advanced 140% over the past month while most of the broader crypto market suffered declines.

After Zcash's rally, the firm is sitting on around 120% in paper gains having an average cost basis of $291 per token.

New Hampshire is the first U.S. state to allow the issuance of a municipal conduit bond backed by Bitcoin. This is a big step forward in bringing digital assets into traditional finance. 

The New Hampshire Business Finance Authority (BFA) gave the green light for up to $100 million in bonds to buy and hold digital currency, which made the move official. 

This historic judgment will let borrowers use overcollateralized Bitcoin to get money, which will test the limits of how state-level public finance may use modern technologies.

Minutes from a recent BFA meeting show that everyone agreed to let WaveRose Depositor, LLC issue a taxable conduit revenue bond for up to $100 million. Wave Digital Assets, an asset manager, and Rosemawr Management, a bond expert, designed the bond so that Bitcoin could be used as collateral. 

BitGo is said to be in charge of keeping the Bitcoin safe. Companies can get money by posting about 160% of the bond's value in Bitcoin as collateral under this structure. If the value of Bitcoin as collateral falls below around 130% of the bond's principal, a required liquidation will happen to protect bondholders. 

The state or taxpayers don't have to worry about losing money; the BFA just approves and oversees the trade. The investors' positions are backed by Bitcoin reserves kept by private custodians. 

The bond follows recognised criteria for municipal and corporate governance, making sure that everything is clear legally and operationally when it comes to protecting investors and following the law.

The goal of this municipal bond is to connect traditional fixed-income investments with digital asset-backed investments. Les Borsai, who helped start Wave Digital Assets, said that this project shows how the public and commercial sectors can work together to make digital reserves more valuable. 

The bond is meant to attract institutional investors by combining the safety and accountability of municipal finance with the opportunity for innovation and profits that come with digital assets.

The transaction fees from this bond will go toward New Hampshire's local innovation and entrepreneurship program, which includes the Bitcoin Economic Development Fund. 

The goal of these funds is to get more businesses in the area to adopt digital assets and to get more people in the state to use them.

New Hampshire's most recent move is part of a lengthy history of using cryptocurrencies. The state became the first in the U.S. to enable government investment in cryptocurrencies earlier this month. This happened after a bill was signed that allowed public funds to invest in digital assets and precious metals. 

There is also a bill in the works to make it easier for people to mine cryptocurrencies at home. This is part of a continuing drive to attract firms and investors interested in cryptocurrencies. The local government's open-mindedness toward digital currency has helped make New Hampshire a good place for crypto businesses to set up shop. 

State officials have been trying to use Bitcoin in government transactions since 2015, even if past attempts to do so through legislation have failed. New Hampshire is setting an example for the broader use of digital assets in public finance by issuing the first Bitcoin-backed municipal bond in the U.S. 

The state's new approach, which emphasises stringent collateral requirements and tight controls, could serve as a blueprint for future financial products that combine the digital and traditional economies.

Bitcoin (BTC) dropped to $90,000 on Tuesday, stirring concern that more downside may be ahead – except for Standard Chartered head of digital asset research Geoffrey Kendrick, and for investors increasingly turning to Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER), the fastest Layer-2 built on Bitcoin.

Bitcoin Hyper's ICO has now surpassed $28 million, signaling growing confidence in the project as BTC trades sideways. The funding provides a solid foundation for development that many believe could reignite Bitcoin's momentum heading into year-end or early next year, with some analysts eyeing $200,000 as a realistic upside target.

Of course, Bitcoin will need a fresh catalyst to reach those levels, and utility demand is the catalyst many investors believe is missing. That's the gap Bitcoin Hyper aims to fill, and if it succeeds, both the Layer-2 and its early adopters stand to benefit significantly.

Those looking to secure HYPER at presale pricing can do so at $0.013295 per token, with approximately 7 hours remaining before the next pricing round begins at a higher rate.



Kendrick said the recent Bitcoin sell-off may be nearing its end, calling the drop a “fast and painful” repeat of the two prior 30% corrections that followed the launch of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs. 

According to Kendrick, several key valuation and sentiment indicators have now reset to levels historically associated with market bottoms, including Strategy's modified NAV, which is a measure comparing the value of its publicly traded shares to the value of the Bitcoin it holds. 

This metric has fallen to parity for the first time in months, indicating that the share price matches the underlying Bitcoin value one-to-one, which implies investor optimism has completely unwound.

He noted that other metrics have “collapsed to absolute zero,” signaling seller exhaustion and capitulation. On-chain data reflects a similar trend, with short-term holder losses slowing and traditional bottoming signals emerging. Kendrick's base case now calls for a rebound and a potential rally into year-end.

Another widely followed analyst on X, known as Top Gainer Today, shares a similar long-term perspective. He believes Bitcoin could eventually reach the same aggressive price targets proposed by figures like Fundstrat's Tom Lee and BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes (around $200,000), though he sees this timeline stretching into the first quarter of 2026.

But as mentioned, Bitcoin will need a fresh catalyst to make those targets realistic, something the asset has never truly had before. Bitcoin Hyper, with the utility-driven demand it aims to create for BTC, could be positioning itself as the missing catalyst analysts have been waiting for.

The ecosystem hosts applications built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), where Bitcoin serves as the medium of exchange that powers every interaction.

In this environment, BTC can move freely across decentralized applications, which is something the Bitcoin network has never supported natively. Previous attempts at Bitcoin Layer-2 chains have failed to gain meaningful traction, but Bitcoin Hyper's approach is different: it combines Solana-level speed and throughput with Bitcoin's settlement security, ensuring that every transaction ultimately anchors back to the base chain.

This system works through Bitcoin Hyper's canonical bridge, where BTC is locked on the main chain and re-minted inside the Layer-2 as a wrapped asset capable of moving fluidly across SVM-powered apps. Settlement always returns to Bitcoin, preserving the asset's integrity while enabling utility that the base layer was never built to handle.

If this ecosystem gains traction – and it has strong potential to do so – it will be because developers can utilize familiar Solana tooling, making onboarding simple and fast. That ease of development could open the door for a surge in DeFi, gaming, and even real-world applications powered directly by BTC.

At the same time, the HYPER token, which investors have been buying aggressively, is positioned to grow in tandem. HYPER powers transaction fees, serves as the network's staking currency, and acts as the governance token that shapes the entire ecosystem's evolution. 

As the utility of BTC expands, demand for HYPER scales with it, creating a dual-engine model that early adopters are already betting big on.

Investor interest in HYPER isn't just tied to its role in powering BTC transactions. It also stems from the belief that Bitcoin Hyper represents the next major bet linked to Bitcoin's growth cycle – a rare opportunity to capture upside that many feel they missed with BTC itself. 

That's part of the reason one whale bought nearly $500,000 worth of HYPER this month, just after another snapped up $833,000 worth in October.

Analysts are already laying out aggressive price targets. Cryptonews analyst Alan Draper predicts that HYPER will reach $0.0583 in 2025, assuming it launches within the next few weeks – a 338.6% increase from its current presale level. 

For 2026, as BTC is expected to climb toward more ambitious price targets as projected by Top Gainer Today, Draper estimates a potential increase of 1,071% from today's price.

Some are even more bullish, like popular influencer Crypto Blockspot, who believes HYPER could climb as high as 1,000x, arguing that its major tie to BTC utility could unlock massive upside once the ecosystem goes live.



Of course, these are predictions, and presale participants should always do their own research and evaluate whether the project aligns with their strategy. 

But the core idea behind all these projections is consistent: HYPER is still at its lowest possible price point, and timing is everything if the upside plays out.

To get HYPER, head to the Bitcoin Hyper presale website and buy using SOL, ETH, USDT, USDC, BNB, or even a credit card. 

Bitcoin Hyper recommends Best Wallet – one of the best crypto and Bitcoin wallets – where HYPER is listed under its Upcoming Tokens section, making it simple to buy, track, and claim once live.

The Best Wallet app is available for download on both Google Play and the Apple App Store.

CHICAGO - A federal grand jury indicted the founder of a Chicago cryptocurrency company accused of operating an illegal $10 million money laundering scheme. 

What we know:

Firas Isa, 36, was accused of conspiring to launder proceeds from wire fraud and narcotics offenses through his business, Virtual Assets LLC, which operated as Crypto Dispensers.

The company ran cash-to-cryptocurrency exchanges and a network of crypto ATMs nationwide, allowing users to convert cash into digital currency.

According to the indictment unsealed in the Northern District of Illinois, people sent more than $10 million to Crypto Dispensers, Isa or a co-conspirator. Prosecutors alleged Isa converted the money into cryptocurrency and transferred it to virtual wallets to disguise the source of the funds while knowing the proceeds came from illegal activity.

Isa and Virtual Assets LLC were each charged with one count of money laundering conspiracy, a felony that could be punishable by up to 20 years in federal prison.

What's next:

A status hearing was scheduled for Jan. 30, 2026 in U.S. District court.

What if the early moment you missed once is happening again right now? For many traders, Hyperliquid is the perfect reminder that timing determines everything. When Hyperliquid was still a small, emerging L2 ecosystem with a blazing-fast on-chain order book, most of the market ignored its potential. But once adoption surged, early believers enjoyed exponential gains, while late entries were left watching from the sidelines.

Today, another early chance is emerging through a rapidly accelerating token launch. LivLive ($LIVE) is gaining momentum fast, attracting investors seeking the next 1000x crypto presale before the market catches up. With AR-driven presence verification, real-world utility, and powerful bonus multipliers, LivLive is shaping up to be one of the most compelling early entries of the year.

LivLive ($LIVE) launched at $0.02 and has already surpassed $2.1 million in early-stage funding. Its rapid momentum comes from a utility-first vision, positioning it as a strong contender for the Next 1000x crypto presale. At the core of LivLive's ecosystem is real-world presence verification powered by smart AR wristbands, enabling brands, users, and communities to connect through authentic, location-based interactions.

A major innovation is LivLive's Layered Gamification and XP Ecosystem, designed to keep users engaged long after the presale. Participants earn XP for attending events, completing tasks, scanning AR markers, engaging with partner locations, and interacting with the community. As XP accumulates, users level up, unlock new perks, access premium AR experiences, and gain special in-app benefits. This game-like progression loop transforms real-world actions into valuable digital rewards, establishing a long-term engagement engine that most early-stage tokens simply do not offer.

A $3,000 entry at LivLive's starting price of $0.02 places investors in the top reward tier, automatically qualifying them for both presale bonus codes, EARLY100 (100% bonus) and BOOST200 (200% bonus). This gives early participants one of the strongest positions in this rapidly emerging next 1000x crypto presale.

This results in a total allocation of 450,000 tokens, valued at $90,000 at Stage 10's $0.20 price. The ability to activate both EARLY100 and BOOST200 at this level is a major reason why early buyers view LivLive as a leading contender for the next 1000x crypto presale, where strategic early entry unlocks massive potential upside long before higher stages arrive.

Hyperliquid has become one of the most advanced decentralized trading ecosystems in the market, but its rise serves as a powerful reminder of what early conviction can achieve. Before its fully on-chain order book, ultra-fast execution layer, and deep liquidity gained mainstream attention, the majority of traders overlooked its potential. Only early adopters who understood the strength of its architecture captured the project's most explosive growth phase, proving how crucial timing is in the crypto space.

As Hyperliquid became a major force in decentralized trading, its early window of exponential upside disappeared forever, leaving latecomers wishing they had recognized the opportunity sooner. This is precisely why investors aggressively search for the next 1000x crypto presale, knowing that the biggest gains always happen before the world realizes a project's true value. Today, many believe LivLive is stepping into that same early moment, offering a fresh chance to act before the next major breakout.

LivLive is quickly emerging as one of the most promising early-stage crypto launches heading into 2025. Its AR integration, real-world engagement, layered gamification, robust bonus structure, and rapid presale momentum position it as a strong candidate for the next 1000x crypto presale.

With over $2.1 million raised and 100%–200% bonuses still active, early buyers have a rare window to lock in maximized allocations before stage prices rise. Hyperliquid proved what early conviction can achieve. LivLive is now offering a new chance to act before the next breakout occurs.

New on-chain data from Santiment suggests that the latest wave of selling across Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP looks less like the start of a new collapse and more like a fatigue event from smaller market participants. 

It is not about big funds unloading in the background, as the pressure now comes from short-term holders and retail wallets that finally stopped trying to sit through another leg down.

According to Santment's recent data, wallets holding less than 0.01 BTC reduced their balances by about 0.36% over the past five days, while sub-0.1 ETH wallets cut roughly 0.9% in a month, and XRP wallets with under 100 coins offloaded 1.38% since the beginning of November. 

Santiment">

These numbers are not enormous on their own, but they describe the same pattern: smaller holders are the ones that are actively sending coins to the market.

Retail panic on crypto market

This thesis is backed by CryptoQuant's numbers too, with around 65,200 BTC being sent to exchanges in unrealized loss over a single day, a volume worth close to $6 billion at current prices. This indicator does not track completed trades, but it shows how much Bitcoin short-term holders move onto exchanges while still underwater. 

In practice, such spikes usually mean that part of this supply is already sold, while the rest is waiting in line on the order books.

Historically, this group tends to act late. They sell after weeks of frustration, not at the first sign of weakness. Once they have pushed most of their coins onto exchanges, additional downside usually requires a new source of supply. 

If that source does not appear, the price often stabilizes and then recovers simply because the most impatient cohort has already exited. From that angle, the current mix of heavy STH transfers and synchronized retail selling across XRP, Bitcoin and Ethereum can be read as an early sign that the sell side is running out of energy rather than gaining it.

Advocates argue the ARC token will lower India's borrowing costs, strengthen the rupee and stem outflows to dollar-backed cryptocurrencies

Proponents argue that the Asset Reserve Certificate (ARC) could hasten the global drive towards de-dollarisation, lower India's borrowing costs and create a “virtuous cycle” for public funding by diversifying the country's investor base.

Every unit of the regulated digital token would be backed one-to-one by Indian government securities or treasury bills – debt instruments issued by the state to finance public spending – maintaining a steady value pegged to the rupee while operating on private blockchain infrastructure.

On Tuesday, the market's leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC), experienced a notable decline, dropping toward the $89,000 mark, its lowest price in seven months, resulting in over $1 billion in liquidations across the crypto market within the past 24 hours. 

However, despite this downturn, altcoins have exhibited significant stability when compared to the performance of BTC. Analysts from the Bull Theory have provided insights into why altcoins are holding strong during this period.

Bitcoin Dominance Falls

In a recent social media post on social media site X (previously Twitter), the analysts asserted that the recent decline in BTC's value was not characterized by typical selling pressure; instead, it is seen as a result of structured institutional selling. 

This was reflected in negative flows from Coinbase and the manner in which the candlestick patterns formed. Following this structured selling, panic selling ensued as traders who were already facing losses began to exit their positions hastily. 

This panic selling led to rapid declines in BTC's price; however, altcoins, having already approached a state of seller exhaustion, did not experience significant drops.

In previous scenarios where BTC has faced downturns, its dominance in the market typically surges as traders flock to Bitcoin for safety. Yet, the current situation is different. 

Bitcoin's dominance remains below the 50-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA), and the market has recently seen a series of red candles. Such a decline in dominance while BTC is in a downward spiral is unusual, suggesting that altcoins are not being entirely abandoned by traders.

Ethereum (ETH) has lost its 50-week EMA but is making attempts to reclaim it. Throughout this month, BTC and ETH have experienced nearly identical declines, yet ETH has shown quicker recovery patterns. 

The analysts highlighted that during previous cycles, whenever Ethereum holds its ground better than Bitcoin during similar downturns, altcoins tend to demonstrate strength as well.

Altcoins Show Strength Amid BTC's Decline

The Bull Theory analysts also noted that many altcoin pairs against BTC have rebounded to levels seen before the significant crash that occurred on October 10th, with some even trading above those thresholds. 

This, according to their analysis, indicates a few key points: altcoins are outperforming BTC, the current pressure feels isolated rather than widespread, and the sell-off lacks broader implications across the market.

The Analysts suggest that this combination of factors is one of the strongest signals of a market bottom. When BTC is experiencing a downturn, dominance is declining, and alt/BTC pairs are on the rise, it often points to a capitulation phase for altcoins.

As of this writing, Bitcoin has recovered above the $93,000 mark. However, the leading cryptocurrency has erased all of its year-to-date gains, while extending the gap to record levels by 26%.

 Cloudflare says a bug in its Bot Management System crashed 20% of webpages on Tuesday, including some of the crypto industry's biggest websites. 

Internet services provider Cloudflare says that a fault in its bot detection system triggered an outage that took down around 20% of webpages, including several crypto platforms.Cloudflare said in a post-mortem statement on Tuesday that a “feature file” used by its Bot Management System to fight off cyberattacks grew beyond its normal limit, leading to a failure in Cloudflare's software.

The company initially suspected the incident was caused by a hyper-scale Distributed Denial of Service attack, but confirmed there was no cyberattack or malicious activity.

Cloudflare handles roughly 20% of internet traffic and powers around one-third of the top 10,000 websites, apps and services.

Its outage took out the websites for Coinbase, Blockchain.com, Ledger, BitMEX, Toncoin, Arbiscan, and DefiLlama, as well as X and ChatGPT, leading some crypto commentators to remark on the crypto industry's reliance on centralized systems, some of which also went offline when Amazon Web Services suffered a network outage last month. 

A spokesperson for EthStorage, which offers a product allowing Ethereum to be used as a web server, told Cointelegraph that the AWS and Cloudflare outages show “centralized infrastructure will always create single points of failure.”

“A complete decentralized web stack is needed more than ever,” the company said.

Last Wednesday, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin authored a “Trustless Manifesto,” which called on industry builders to never sacrifice decentralization in pursuit of adoption.

Buterin and Ethereum Foundation researchers Yoav Weiss and Marissa Posner, said crypto platforms sacrifice trustlessness from the moment that they integrate a hosted node or centralized relayer, explaining that while it feels harmless, each new checkpoint becomes a potential chokepoint.

Most human secretory pathway proteins are N-glycosylated by oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complexes as they enter the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1,2,3. Recent work revealed a substrate-assisted mechanism by which N-glycosylation of the chaperone glucose-regulated protein 94 (GRP94) is regulated to control cell surface receptor signalling4. Here we report the structure of a natively isolated GRP94 folding intermediate tethered to a specialized CCDC134-bound translocon. Together with functional analysis, the data reveal how a conserved N-terminal extension in GRP94 inhibits OST-A and how structural rearrangements within the translocon shield the tethered nascent chain from inappropriate OST-B glycosylation. These interactions depend on a hydrophobic CCDC134 groove, which recognizes a non-native conformation of nascent GRP94. Our results define a mechanism of regulated N-glycosylation and illustrate how the nascent chain remodels the translocon to facilitate its own biogenesis.

Protein N-glycosylation is catalysed by OST complexes in the ER membrane. About 20% of human proteins are modified with N-glycans, which affect their folding, degradation, trafficking and function1,2. Defects in the cellular N-glycosylation machinery cause a group of inherited diseases called congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG)5, and pathogenic missense mutations resulting in a gain or loss of N-glycosylation have been described6,7.

Metazoan genomes encode two OST complexes3. OST-A associates with ER membrane-bound ribosomes docked to SEC61 and TRAP (the ‘secretory' translocon), giving it priority access to the unfolded nascent chain as it enters the lumen8,9. Sites skipped by OST-A can be modified by OST-B, which can act co- or post-translationally but does not associate with the ribosome–translocon complex (RTC)10. Notably, the presence of an acceptor sequon (Asn-X-Thr/Ser, X≠Pro) does not ensure its modification11,12. Factors such as sequence context, folding kinetics and cellular metabolic state influence acceptor site usage, leading to variability across cells, tissues and disease states13,14. The functional consequences of this variability remain poorly understood.

Glycosylation of normally unused acceptor sequons can target proteins for degradation by the ERAD pathway15,16. An important example is GRP94 (or HSP90B1), an abundant ER chaperone with six acceptor sequons (Fig. 1a). Whereas GRP94 is typically glycosylated at a single site (N217), glycosylation of up to five ‘facultative' sites has been observed in cells subjected to different forms of ER stress17,18,19,20.

Note that FKBP11 and CCDC134 are among the most enriched transcripts in their respective samples, because each protein is tagged at its N terminus (immediately following the SP); this serves as an internal control for the immunoprecipitation. d, Comparison of log2[transcript abundance] (transcripts per million, TPM) for all transcripts recovered following FKBP11 and CCDC134 affinity purification (n = 9,242). e, Volcano plots for all secretory and transmembrane transcripts showing −log10[adjusted P-value] versus log2[enrichment] for each sample. For clarity, FKBP11 and CCDC134 transcripts are not shown. f, CCDC134 and FKBP11 interaction profiles for GRP94; mean (line) and range (shading) for two biological replicates are indicated. GRP94 residues to the left of the vertical grey bars are in the lumen at the onset of CCDC134 and FKBP11 engagement, respectively. Diagram of GRP94 and the position of the ribosome (grey) and SEC61 channel (yellow) at the onset of CCDC134 engagement are shown at the top. For source data related to panels b–e, see Supplementary Table 1.

A pathway regulating GRP94 hyperglycosylation was recently identified through genome-wide CRISPR–Cas9 screening4. This process depends critically on the lumenal ER protein CCDC134 and components of OST-A that recognize a conserved, metazoan-specific N-terminal extension of GRP94 to suppress glycosylation of its facultative sites during synthesis. Disrupting this pathway causes GRP94 hyperglycosylation and degradation and impairs the folding, maturation and trafficking of its receptor clients (for example, IGF1R, LRP6 and TLR4) with broad effects on cell and tissue function4,21,22. Indeed, mutations that cause loss of CCDC134 function impair WNT and IGF1R signalling, causing the bone disorder osteogenesis imperfecta4,23,24,25. The structural basis by which these factors control GRP94 acceptor site usage at the secretory translocon remains unclear.

In earlier work, we used affinity purification, mRNA sequencing and mass spectrometry to identify FKBP11 as a transmembrane protein that can bind ribosome-associated secretory translocons during synthesis of proteins with long lumenal segments26. Notably, CCDC134 and GRP94 were identified as co-purifying factors. In a reciprocal experiment, FKBP11 was recovered following affinity purification by means of a FLAG tag on CCDC134, and this interaction was dependent on the ribosome, as neither FKBP11 nor CCDC134 recovered the other component in the absence of ribosomes (Extended Data Fig. 1a,b).

To identify cotranslational clients of FKBP11 and CCDC134, we used a recently developed ribosome profiling method optimized for low-input samples27,28 (Extended Data Fig. 1c–e). As observed previously for FKBP11 (ref. 26), affinity-purified CCDC134-bound ribosomes were modestly enriched for transcripts encoding proteins with long translocated segments (Fig. 1b). This seemed to depend on FKBP11, as most transcripts enriched by CCDC134 were also enriched by FKBP11, but not vice versa (Fig. 1c). Notably, GRP94 was strongly enriched by both factors and was also the most abundant transcript in each elution (Fig. 1c–e).

Positional analysis revealed distinct interaction profiles for FKBP11 and CCDC134 during synthesis of the 803-residue GRP94 polypeptide. FKBP11 arrived first, when the nascent chain was about 161 residues long (Fig. 1f). At this point, GRP94 residues 22–106 were in the lumen (assuming that approximately 55 residues are buried in the ribosome exit tunnel and SEC61 channel). CCDC134 began to arrive shortly thereafter, when the nascent chain was about 204 residues long. At this point, GRP94 residues 22–149 were in the lumen, including all of the pre-N segment (residues 22–74) and the first helix of the N-domain (αN1, residues 82–91). This is consistent with a previous analysis of GRP94 translocation intermediates assembled by in vitro translation4. CCDC134 was stabilized further as synthesis continued, peaking as the GRP94 N-domain finished translocating into the lumen. Once recruited, both factors persisted until translation was terminated. Thus, FKBP11 and CCDC134 engage the translocon early during GRP94 synthesis and remain bound until synthesis is complete.

To understand how these factors are organized, we prepared FKBP11-bound ribosomes from FLAG–FKBP11 HEK293 cells and solved the structure by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) (Fig. 2a, Extended Data Figs. 2–6 and Extended Data Table 1). The maps show well-defined density for SEC61, OST-A, A/P- and P/E-site transfer RNAs and the ribosome. Density was also visible for the TRAP complex, portions of the lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) donor and several N-glycans. Nascent chain density was visible in the ribosome exit tunnel and SEC61 channel, which adopts an open conformation with its displaced plug helix packed against SEC61β, SEC61γ and DC2 (ref. 29), and RAMP4 bound at the lateral gate30. Thus, these natively isolated FBKP11–ribosome complexes represent physiologically relevant complexes captured in the act of translation and translocation.

Additional lumenal density was visible near OST-A (Fig. 2a). This density is distinct from weak, unassigned densities visible near OST-A in a recent cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) study29. Although FKBP11 and CCDC134 do not interact in the absence of ribosomes, AlphaFold predicted a high-confidence complex that was fit into a portion of this density with only minor adjustments to each subunit's flexible C-terminal region (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Figs. 4a and 5a). This configuration buries the canonical ligand binding site of FKBP11 and positions its conserved and positively charged C-terminal helix, previously shown to be important for ribosome binding26, adjacent to uL22 and 28S rRNA H24 on the cytosolic side of the membrane (Extended Data Fig. 6f,g).

The remaining density was assigned to residues 25–283 of nascent GRP94, which is observed in a non-native conformation (Fig. 2c). The pre-N segment (residues 22–74), which is largely unstructured or disordered in previously determined structures of GRP94, was modelled into continuous density that wraps around the OST-A active site, in good agreement with high-confidence AlphaFold modelling (Extended Data Figs. 4b and 5b). AlphaFold was also used to guide placement of the first N-domain helix (αN1, residues 82–91), which normally packs against the ATP-binding site in folded GRP94 (Fig. 2c), into density extending along the surface of CCDC134 (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Figs. 4c and 5c). Portions of the globular N-domain, including its central helix and most of the eight-stranded β-sheet, were placed into weak but characteristic density adjacent to CCDC134 (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 6h). No density was observed for bound nucleotide, the flexible N-domain active-site ‘lid' or the M- and C-terminal domains. Thus, the structure reveals a bona fide GRP94 translation intermediate(s) captured in a partially folded state while bound to the secretory translocon and two accessory factors, FKBP11 and CCDC134 (Fig. 2e).

The pre-N segment extends deep into the OST-A active-site cavity, burying more than 3,100 Å2 of surface area against STT3A (about 1,680 Å2), DC2 (about 540 Å2) and SEC61α (about 930 Å2) (Fig. 3a,b). This negatively charged region (residues 25–79) (Fig. 3c,d) is rich in conserved residues4 and forms an extensive network of intra- and inter-molecular contacts. This region is highly sensitive to mutation, as most variants tested in RKO cells led to GRP94 hyperglycosylation and degradation and, consequently, to reduced cell surface expression of its clients IGF1Rβ and LRP6 (Fig. 3e). Notably, these mutations did not affect GRP94 folding or chaperone activity, as they did not impair the activity of a variant lacking all five facultative sequons (5N; Extended Data Fig. 7b). Thus, the metazoan-specific pre-N segment regulates GRP94 hyperglycosylation, not its catalytic activity.

The pre-N interactions within the acceptor site binding pocket mimic those of previously determined structures of short (about seven residues) peptides bound to yeast OST and human OST-B (refs. 31,32) (Fig. 3f). Density was observed for portions of the LLO glycan, polyprenyl chain and pyrophosphate, but not an active-site divalent cation (Extended Data Fig. 6b). The lumenal EL5 loop of STT3A is in an ordered, ‘engaged' conformation, packed against the LLO and GRP94. Notably, the conserved GRP94 ‘SRT' motif (residues 42–44) forms a tight 180° turn that positions S42 close to the donor LLO substrate (Fig. 3g). Here, the hydroxyl group of T44 contacts the STT3A WWD motif, which is essential for acceptor sequon recognition33,34, explaining why mutations in either site lead to GRP94 hyperglycosylation and degradation4.

The central (+1) position of an acceptor sequon can be any residue except proline, which is incompatible with the tight turn conformation required for OST-A binding. As expected of a substrate mimic, an arginine-to-proline mutation at GRP94 position 43 resulted in hyperglycosylation and degradation (Fig. 3e). Notably, mutating this position to a negatively charged glutamate (and, to a lesser extent, alanine or isoleucine) also caused GRP94 hyperglycosylation, whereas lysine was tolerated4. A positive charge at the +1 position of GRP94 is probably required to neutralize the flanking negative charges on E40 and D46 that are brought together on binding (Fig. 3d).

These observations define the pre-N segment as a pseudo-substrate inhibitor that occludes the STT3A acceptor site binding pocket during GRP94 synthesis to limit glycosylation of the facultative sites. This mechanism differs from that proposed for the small-molecule OST inhibitor NGI-1, which traps a catalytically inactive conformation of LLO but does not prevent acceptor peptide binding21.

The persistent binding of the 53-residue pre-N segment contrasts with the transient engagement of nascent polypeptides as they enter the lumen, suggesting differences in how they interact with OST-A35,36,37. Unlike the conserved and extensive interface used by the pre-N domain, recognition of bona fide acceptor sequences is primarily mediated by contacts between the acceptor sequon and STT3A31,32,38. Consistent with this distinction, we identified distal STT3A variants (D363R and E623R) that caused GRP94 hyperglycosylation and reduced surface expression of LRP6 but had no effect on the OST-A-specific substrate prosaposin (PSAP)10 (Fig. 3h–j). Notably, these residues are close to the known CDG mutations Y360S and V626A39,40,41, the latter of which causes GRP94 hyperglycosylation in patient fibroblasts19. This suggests that the disease phenotypes of some CDG-causing STT3A mutations may be because of GRP94 and its clients, rather than (or as well as) a general N-glycosylation defect.

Pre-N binding to OST-A is necessary but not sufficient to fully suppress GRP94 hyperglycosylation, which also requires CCDC134 (ref. 4). CCDC134 is recruited by a network of interactions with the translocon and nascent GRP94 (Fig. 4a). More than 2,100 Å2 of CCDC134 surface area is buried in contacts with FKBP11 (about 790 Å2) and STT3A (about 320 Å2) through its globular domain, and OST48 (about 630 Å2), RPN2 (about 330 Å2) and RPN1 (about 110 Å2) through its long C-terminal extension. Although FKBP11 is well positioned to help recruit CCDC134, this is not strictly required, because HEK293 and RKO cells lacking FKBP11 did not show a GRP94 hyperglycosylation defect (Extended Data Fig. 7c,e). However, STT3A variants carrying mutations in the small CCDC134–STT3A interface were unable to fully suppress GRP94 hyperglycosylation4. Similarly, a CCDC134 variant lacking its OST-A-binding C-terminal extension (Δ194–224) (but retaining the ‘QSEL' ER retention signal) did not fully rescue a CCDC134 knockout, probably because of impaired assembly at the translocon (Fig. 4e and Extended Data Fig. 7f).

The top inset shows a close-up of the GRP94 ‘bridge' helix (magenta, with αN1 in yellow) connecting the OST-A active site (green) and CCDC134.

The Δ194–224 construct is only visible in the anti-HA blot because the anti-CCDC134 antibody recognizes a C-terminal epitope that is deleted from this construct. f, ER and plasma membrane (PM) levels of IGFR1β and levels of monoglycosylated (mg) and hyperglycosylated (hg) GRP94 in GRP94 knockout RKO cells stably expressing the indicated GRP94 or GRP94-5N variant. The location of I66 along the bridge helix is shown in panel a. See also Extended Data Fig. 7g. Data shown in panels e and f are representative of at least two independent experiments. For gel source data, see Supplementary Fig. 1.

The globular domain of CCDC134 makes further interactions with nascent GRP94, burying almost 1,100 Å2 of CCDC134 surface area in two distinct interfaces (Fig. 4b). The smaller interface (about 350 Å2) involves the partially folded GRP94 N-domain, which packs loosely against CCDC134. The larger interface (about 720 Å2) involves the amphipathic GRP94 helix αN1 (including residues 82–91 and several flanking residues), which flips about 180° from its canonical position in folded GRP94 to pack against a conserved hydrophobic groove on the surface of CCDC134 (Fig. 4b,c). In this configuration, the canonical αN1 binding site in the N-domain is occluded by CCDC134 (Fig. 4b). Notably, the αN1 region is required for CCDC134-dependent suppression of GRP94 hyperglycosylation4. Consistent with this, CCDC134 variants carrying structure-guided hydrophobic-to-charge mutations within the hydrophobic groove were recruited to the translocon but did not prevent GRP94 hyperglycosylation in CCDC134 knockout RKO cells (Fig. 4d,e and Extended Data Fig. 7f). Thus, CCDC134 binding to αN1 and pre-N binding to the OST-A active site are necessary to fully suppress GRP94 hyperglycosylation.

In nascent GRP94, αN1 and the pre-N segment are connected by a long helical element, termed the bridge helix (residues 63–91) (Fig. 4a,b). This helix is not observed in experimental and predicted structures of GRP94, which show considerable conformational flexibility in this region42,43 (Fig. 2c). The paucity of direct contacts between CCDC134 and STT3A suggested that rigidity of the bridge helix may be functionally important. Consistent with this, individual helix-disrupting proline substitutions at positions along the bridge helix (I66, L69) caused GRP94 hyperglycosylation, whereas alanine substitutions were tolerated (Fig. 4f and Extended Data Fig. 7g). Notably, these mutations did not affect folding or chaperone activity of the mature protein, as they did not impair the activity of the 5N variant. Thus, the bridge helix promotes GRP94 binding by rigidifying the connection between the two key regulatory surfaces of CCDC134 and OST-A.

These data show how CCDC134 recognizes a non-native conformation of nascent GRP94 to occlude the OST-A active site and tether the growing polypeptide chain to the translocon. This explains why CCDC134 is stabilized at the secretory translocon during GRP94 synthesis4 (Fig. 1f) and why fully folded GRP94 does not inhibit OST-A or OST-B post-translationally, despite its abundance in the ER lumen.

The pre-N and N-domain of GRP94 remain tethered to the translocon until translation is terminated (Fig. 1f). Density for the M- and C-domains—which account for nearly 60% of the mature protein—is not visible in the structure, and superimposed full-length GRP94 monomers42,43 show numerous intra- and inter-molecular clashes, including with CCDC134 and subunits of OST-A (Extended Data Fig. 8). This suggests that the native N–M and M–C domain interfaces cannot form until synthesis is complete.

The TRAP complex adopts different positions in previously determined translocon structures29,44,45. In the CCDC134-bound secretory translocon, it shifts away from the tethered and partially folded GRP94 N-domain. Relative to a previously determined cryo-ET structure of the secretory translocon, the TRAP transmembrane bundle moves away from the SEC61γ N-terminus and the TRAPα TMD is no longer visible near the SEC61α hinge29 (Fig. 5a). In its place, we observed density for a small four-helix bundle, which was assigned to KCP2, the DC2-binding subunit of OST-A (refs. 9,46,47,48) (Fig. 5a and Extended Data Figs. 4d and 5d). The DC2 N-terminus extends more than 20 Å along the membrane to bind KCP2 by means of a cleft on its cytosolic face. This interaction buries more than 1,200 Å2 of DC2 surface area and loosely tethers KCP2 near the SEC61α hinge, SEC61γ, the ribosome and the repositioned TRAP TMDs.

Arrow indicates movement of the TRAP transmembrane segments, which is accompanied by displacement of the TRAPα TMD.

For clarity, only the lumenal domain of FKBP11 is depicted. See text for details.

Notably, the TRAP lumenal domain shifts from its position at the SEC61α hinge loop44 to form a new interface with RPN2 (Fig. 5b,c). This creates a large lumenal vestibule adjacent to the SEC61 channel exit that is lined by TRAP, OST-A, CCDC134 and the partially folded GRP94 N-domain (Fig. 5d). Here, the downstream domains of tethered GRP94 can begin folding in close proximity to the translocon, thereby limiting inappropriate cotranslational glycosylation of the M-domain by OST-B acting in trans10.

Our findings lead to a molecular model for regulated GRP94 N-glycosylation (Fig. 5e). FKBP11 is recruited to the secretory translocon as the pre-N segment translocates through SEC61 and begins to occlude the OST-A active site. Once FKBP11 is bound, CCDC134 is progressively stabilized through a network of interactions with FKBP11, OST-A and the elongating GRP94 chain. Key to this is binding of the CCDC134 hydrophobic groove to a transiently exposed amphipathic helix (αN1) in GRP94. This configuration tethers GRP94 to the translocon and stabilizes pre-N binding to the STT3A active site to prevent glycosylation of downstream sites by OST-A. The relatively complex architecture and high contact order49 of the N-domain suggest that it folds slowly, leaving its constitutive glycosylation site (N217) accessible to OST-B (acting in trans) as it enters the lumen. Once packed against CCDC134, however, the partially folded N-domain contributes to a lumenal vestibule that shields downstream facultative sites from OST-B while the M-domain attempts to fold. As synthesis finishes and GRP94 is released, the αN1 helix packs against the N-domain, leaving the mature (folded) GRP94 incapable of inhibiting OST-A or OST-B.

This pathway does not seem to be strictly required for proper GRP94 folding, as constructs lacking all five facultative sites are functional in RKO cells, even when harbouring mutations that disrupt their interactions with OST-A (Extended Data Fig. 7b) or in cells lacking CCDC134 or STT3A4. This raises the question of why the facultative sites are conserved. We propose that they are part of a cotranslational quality control system that has evolved to rapidly detect and degrade GRP94 misfolding events. This would be analogous to cotranslational ubiquitination of nascent polypeptides on cytosolic ribosomes50,51,52, which preferentially targets proteins that fold inefficiently. Notably, GRP94 is a large multidomain and oligomeric protein, prone to misfolding and aggregation53,54. It is also one of the most abundant proteins in the ER lumen. Thus, even a fraction of misfolded GRP94 might be sufficiently toxic in certain cell types or developmental stages to necessitate a dedicated quality control checkpoint at the RTC. Rather than facilitating folding, the function of CCDC134 would be to shield the facultative sites from glycosylation—by occluding the OST-A active site and restricting access of the tethered nascent chain to OST-B—while GRP94 attempts to fold.

Our data suggest that FKBP11 functions as a ribosome-binding adaptor to help recruit CCDC134 to the secretory translocon during GRP94 biosynthesis. Burial of its nominal catalytic site by CCDC134 argues against a role as a nascent chain prolyl isomerase. Although we did not detect GRP94 hyperglycosylation defects in knockout HEK293 or RKO cells, FKBP11 may be required in other contexts. Indeed, FKBP11 is highly expressed in specialized secretory cells and is upregulated in response to various ER stresses55,56,57,58. Notably, FKBP11 knockdown was recently reported to suppress proinflammatory cytokine production in endothelial cells by disrupting NF-κB signalling59, consistent with a link to GRP94 biogenesis and cell-surface receptor signalling.

Our selective ribosome profiling data hint at an additional, more general function for FKBP11 and CCDC134 at the translocon. Hundreds of transcripts were enriched by FKBP11 and CCDC134, albeit at much lower levels than GRP94 (Fig. 1c). Notably, these proteins lack obviously conserved pre-N-like sequences, suggesting that FKBP11 and CCDC134 do not regulate their glycosylation. An intriguing possibility is that FKBP11 and CCDC134 also function more broadly to shield aggregation-prone hydrophobic segments that are transiently exposed during translocation into the ER lumen.

An important concept emerging from recent work is that the subunit composition of the translocon is dynamic29,60,61,62. Understanding how different substrates drive translocon remodelling to support their own biogenesis is an important goal. For nascent GRP94, a key signal is the transient exposure of an amphipathic helix that is recognized by CCDC134 to suppress glycosylation at the secretory translocon. Further studies are needed to explore how the cotranslational folding and modification of other nascent polypeptides is coordinated at the translocon.

Doxycycline-inducible 3xFLAG–CCDC134 (tag inserted after the ER signal sequence) was cloned by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification followed by Gibson assembly (New England Biolabs) into pcDNA5-FRT/TO. Doxycycline-inducible 3xHA–CCDC134 (tag inserted after the ER signal sequence) mutants were cloned by PCR amplification followed by Gibson assembly (New England Biolabs) into pLenti-TRE-rtta3G-BLAST4.

pENTR2B-3xFLAG-GRP94 (wild type) and pENTR2B-3xFLAG-GRP945N (includes mutations in all five facultative sequons: S64A, S109A, S447A, T483I, T504I)4 were used as templates to clone all mutant constructs used to generate RKO addback cell lines. All mutant constructs were generated using PCR amplification followed by Gibson assembly and cloned into pLenti CMV Puro DEST63 using gateway methods. Doxycycline-inducible 3xFLAG–GRP94 (tag inserted after the ER signal sequence) constructs for transient expression in HEK293 cells were cloned by PCR amplification followed by Gibson assembly into pcDNA5/FRT/TO. These were used as templates to generate mutant constructs by QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis (Agilent, 210519, 200514).

pENTR2B-STT3A-FLAG4 was used as a template to generate STT3A mutants using PCR amplification followed by Gibson assembly and cloned into pLenti CMV Puro DEST63 using Gateway methods. All constructs were fully sequenced to confirm accuracy.

Flp-In T-REx 293 cells (Invitrogen) were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in DMEM (Corning, MT10013CV) and supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (GeminiBio, 900-108) and 100 U ml−1 penicillin plus 100 µg ml−1 streptomycin (GeminiBio, 400-109). Cells were checked approximately every 6 months for mycoplasma contamination using the Universal Mycoplasma Detection Kit (ATCC, 30-1012K) and were found to be negative.

FKBP11 (ref. 26) and STT3A60 knockout Flp-In T-REx 293 cell lines were generated by CRISPR–Cas9 as previously described. A CCDC134 knockout cell line was generated similarly. In brief, an sgRNA (5′-AGAAGATGTTTGAGGTGAAG-3′) targeting exon 3 of human CCDC134 was designed using the Synthego CRISPR design tool (https://design.synthego.com) and cloned into pSpCas9(BB)-2A-Puro plasmid (PX459; Addgene #62988). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were selected under 1 µg ml−1 of puromycin (InvivoGen, ant-pr-1) for 72 h. Single cells were isolated by sorting in 96-well plates and allowed to grow clonally. Clonal cells were screened for gene knockout by immunoblotting for CCDC134. Further validation was performed by PCR amplification of ± 200 base pairs of PAM sequence and tracking INDEL by decomposition of Sanger sequencing data using the TIDE web tool64 and Synthego ICE analysis tool. An STT3B knockout cell line was generated similarly with sgRNA (5′-ACACATCATCTTGCATCTCA-3′) targeting exon 2 of human STT3B and validated by immunoblotting and tracking INDEL.

A stable, doxycycline-inducible 3xFLAG-FKBP11 Flp-In T-Rex 293 cell line was generated in FKBP11 knockout cells as previously described26. A stable, doxycycline-inducible 3xFLAG-CCDC134 Flp-In T-REx 293 cell line was generated similarly. Briefly, pOG44 (encoding Flp- recombinase) and pcDNA5 SSER-3xFLAG-CCDC134 at a ratio of 9:1 with 3 µl of TransIT-293 transfection reagent (Mirus Bio, MIR2700) were co-transfected into CCDC134 knockout Flp-In T-REx 293 cells. After 24 h, cells were selected with 100 µg ml−1 of hygromycin for 12 days to obtain the stably integrated cell lines. For doxycycline-inducible expression of 3xFLAG–CCDC134, cells were tested in a range of doxycycline concentrations; overexpression was observed without further doxycycline in the culture media.

Stable addback of tagged GRP94, STT3A or CCDC134 were introduced into clonally derived knockout RKO cells using the lentiviral expression system as described previously4. Briefly, virus was generated by transfecting HEK293T cells in six-well plates with 200 ng pMD2.G (Addgene), 400 ng psPAX2 (Addgene) and 800 ng of the desired pLenti CMV Puro DEST or pLenti-TRE-rtta3G-BLAST construct using 7 μl of 1 mg ml−1 polyethylenimine (Polysciences) per well. Lentivirus-conditioned media was collected after 48 h, filtered through a 0.45-μm filter and 0.5 ml of filtered lentivirus was mixed with 1.5 ml of complete media containing 8 μg ml−1 polybrene (MilliporeSigma). The diluted virus was then added to the indicated cells seeded on six-well plates. 24 h post-infection, cells were split and selected with puromycin (2 μg ml−1) or blasticidin (10 µg ml−1) for 3–7 days or until all of the cells on the control plate are dead. For doxycycline-inducible expression of 3xHA–CCDC134, cells were grown for 24 h in a range of doxycycline concentrations with 5 nM inducing low, near-endogenous expression levels.

Typically, ten 15-cm dishes of the desired HEK293 cell line were grown to approximately 80% confluency, washed once with ice-cold PBS and collected by scraping in ice-cold PBS. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C for future use. For microsome preparation, the frozen cell pellet was thawed, resuspended in hypotonic homogenization buffer (10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 10 mM KOAc, 1 mM MgCl2) and incubated on ice for 30 min. Cells were then mechanically lysed with 50 strokes in a glass Dounce homogenizer chilled in ice and sucrose was added to a final concentration of 200 mM. Whole cells and nuclear fragments were removed by two rounds of centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and the ER-enriched membrane fraction was collected from the supernatant by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Pelleted membrane fractions were resuspended to a total volume of 1 ml in microsome buffer (50 M HEPES pH 7.4, 250 mM KOAc, 10 mM MgCl2, 250 mM sucrose) supplemented with 0.5× cOmplete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, 11836170001) and 1 mM CaCl2. The microsome suspension was treated with 10,000 U ml−1 micrococcal nuclease (MNase) (NEB, M0247S) at 37 °C for 25 min followed by 5 U ml−1 RQ1 RNase-Free DNase (Promega, M610A) for 5 min at room temperature. Nuclease digestion was quenched with 2 mM EGTA and microsomes were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Pelleted microsomes were resuspended in microsome buffer supplemented with 50 U ml−1 SUPERaseIn (Invitrogen, AM2696) to the desired concentration and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C.

Microsomes were prepared as described above, with the following modifications. All buffers were supplemented with 100 ng ml−1 cycloheximide. Samples were kept on ice or at 4 °C throughout, unless otherwise noted. Homogenization buffer was supplemented with 0.5× cOmplete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Nuclear fragments were removed by pelleting twice at 2,800 rpm (1,578 × g) for 10 min. Before MNase treatment, microsomes were resuspended with 1.5 ml of 100 mM KOAc microsome buffer.

Micrococcal nuclease-treated 3xFLAG–CCDC134 and 3xFLAG–FKBP11 microsome pellets (from nine 15-cm dishes) were resuspended with 1 ml microsome buffer supplemented with 2.5% digitonin and 1× cOmplete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). The sample was rotated to solubilize for 30 min and insoluble material was removed by pelleting at 13,500 × g for 15 min. The soluble fraction was layered over a 1-ml sucrose cushion (50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM KOAc, 1 M sucrose, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.25% digitonin) and centrifuged at 250,000 × g for 2 h in a TLA100.3 rotor. The resulting ribosomal pellet was resuspended in 1 ml microsome buffer supplemented with 1.25% digitonin. A portion of this was reserved for sequencing (which served as the ‘input' sample for ribosome profiling) and the remainder was immunoprecipitated in batch using 60 μl anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (MilliporeSigma, A2220) and end-over-end mixing overnight at 4 °C. The sample was subsequently washed four times with 12 column volumes of microsome buffer supplemented with 0.4% digitonin. The sample was eluted twice with 1.5 column volumes of microsome buffer (with 200 mM KOAc, 0.4% digitonin, 0.5 mg ml−1 FLAG peptide). The eluate (which served as the ‘IP' sample for ribosome profiling) was collected using a pre-equilibrated spin filter column, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C (‘IP' sample for sequencing).

To prepare the ribosome profiling library, the RNA concentration in both input and IP samples was determined using the Qubit RNA high-sensitivity assay. To generate RNase footprints, samples with 800 ng of RNA were digested with RNase 1 (LGC Biosearch Technologies, N6901K) at 0.5 U µl−1 in a 90-µl reaction at room temperature for 1.5 h. The reactions were stopped by adding 400 µl of TRIzol (Ambion, 15596026), vortexing thoroughly and then adding 100 µl of chloroform. RNA in the aqueous layer was separated by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and precipitated overnight by adding 0.1 volumes of 3 M sodium acetate (Invitrogen, AM9740), 10 mg of GlycoBlue (Invitrogen, AM9515) and 1.2 volumes of isopropanol (Fisher Scientific, BP2618). Purified RNase footprints were subjected to Rfoot-seq library preparation following a previously published method27,28.

Ribosome profiling data were processed by trimming adaptors with Cutadapt v4.1, removing rRNA reads with Bowtie v2.2.6 (ref. 65) and aligning remaining reads to the human hg38 genome and RefSeq-defined transcriptome with TopHat v2.1.0 (ref. 66). Uniquely mapped reads were used for downstream analyses. High-quality reads showing 3-nt periodicity were adjusted to the ribosomal A-site using RibORF (refs. 67,68,69).

Transcript abundance was quantified as transcripts per million using HTSeq v2.0.3 (ref. 70). Transcript enrichment was calculated as the log2 ratio of IP to input samples, median-centred to all genes and tested for significance using chi-squared tests with Benjamini–Hochberg correction. Positional interaction profiles were generated from codon-level enrichment, computed as the log2 ratio of IP to input at each codon position.

3xFLAG-FKBP11 HEK293 cells were seeded in ten 15-cm dishes and induced with 0.1 ng ml−1 doxycycline for 24 h. Microsomes (A260 of 35) were prepared as described above and solubilized in microsome buffer supplemented with 1.5% digitonin and 1× cOmplete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). After 1 h at 4 °C on a rotating wheel, the solubilized microsomes were diluted 2× with microsome buffer (150 mM KOAc) and cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The cleared supernatant was incubated overnight at 4 °C with approximately 70 µl of anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (MilliporeSigma, A2220) pre-equilibrated with wash buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 200 mM KOAc, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM glutathione, 0.15% digitonin). Resin was washed twice with five column volumes of wash buffer and bound material was eluted with 200 µl of the same buffer supplemented with 0.5 mg ml−1 FLAG peptide (APExBIO, A6001) for 10 min at room temperature. The eluate was passed through a pre-equilibrated approximately 30 µm Pierce spin column (Thermo Fisher, 69725), layered over a 300-µl sucrose cushion (50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM glutathione, 500 mM sucrose, 0.15% digitonin) and centrifuged at 355,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C in a TLA120.1 rotor (Beckman Coulter; Optima MAX-XP). The ribosome pellet was resuspended in 20 µl of wash buffer supplemented with 0.5 mg ml−1 FLAG peptide to a final A260 of 0.57 and immediately used to freeze grids for single-particle cryo-EM.

Quantifoil R1.2/1.3 400 mesh gold grids with 2 nm ultrathin carbon were glow-discharged for 25 s immediately before use. Using a Thermo Fisher Vitrobot Mark IV, 3 μl of freshly prepared sample was applied to the grid, incubated at 22 °C and 100% humidity for 60 s, blotted for 7 s, drained for 0.5 s and frozen in liquid-nitrogen-cooled ethane. Three datasets (811, 1,684 and 4,074 videos) were collected on an FEI Titan Krios at 300 KV with EPU software, using a defocus range from −1.9 to −0.9 μm. Super-resolution videos (pixel size = 0.84 Å) were recorded at a nominal magnification of 53,000× using a K3 BioQuantum direct electron detector (Gatan) and a total electron exposure of 60 e− Å−2 over 52 frames.

All data processing was performed using RELION 5.0 (ref. 71). Videos were motion-corrected using MotionCor2 (ref. 72) with 7 × 5 patches and dose weighting. The contrast transfer function (CTF) was estimated with CTFFIND4.1 (ref. 73). An initial particle set was generated by automated picking using the Laplacian-of-Gaussian method with a diameter range of 200 to 300 Å and a threshold of 1, applied to 4,074 videos binned by 2 during motion correction. Particles were extracted using a 128-pixel box (5.04 Å per pixel) and subjected to 2D classification (k = 100, T = 2) to select ribosome-like classes. Selected particles were re-extracted with a 384-pixel box (1.68 Å per pixel) and used for 3D refinement. The resulting map was used to train a Topaz74 model for autopicking across the full combined dataset (6,569 unbinned videos), yielding 741,983 particles. Topaz-picked particles were extracted with a 256-pixel box (2.52 Å per pixel) and subjected to 2D classification (k = 100, T = 2) using a 550 Å spherical mask and 100 classes. From these, 26 ribosome-like classes were selected (676,520 particles). 3D refinement was performed using a low-pass-filtered (60 Å) mammalian ribosome reference, followed by 3D classification (k = 9, T = 4). This yielded four classes corresponding to the secretory translocon (73.8%), one class with weak 40S subunit density (4.5%) and four classes containing poorly aligned particles (21.7%). The 498,812 particles from secretory translocon-containing classes were re-extracted with a 768-pixel box (0.84 Å per pixel) and refined in 3D. Two rounds of 3D refinement and CTF refinement were performed before each dataset was individually polished. The polished particles were then combined for a third round of 3D refinement. To further resolve compositional heterogeneity, focused classification with signal subtraction (k = 9, T = 4, 416-pixel box, 0.84 Å per pixel) was performed using a mask around the translocon region. This yielded three classes with density for the secretory translocon, GRP94, CCDC134 and FKBP11. These were combined (135,132 particles) and refined with local angular searches. An extra round of focused classification with signal subtraction (k = 4, T = 4) targeting GRP94, CCDC134, FKBP11 and STT3A yielded two classes: one with (41.2%) and one without (58.8%) density for the three accessory factors. The particle subset containing GRP94, CCDC134 and FKBP11 (55,750 particles) was subjected to local refinement, yielding Map 1 (translocon-only map). These particles were then re-extracted using a 480-pixel box (1.4 Å per pixel) and further refined. A subsequent 3D refinement focused on the 60S ribosomal subunit yielded Map 2 (RTC map). Maps used for model building and display were uniformly low-pass-filtered to different resolutions, low-pass-filtered by local resolution (in RELION) or post-processed using DeepEMhancer75.

The human 60S subunit from PDB ID 6ZMI and the A/P- and P/E-site tRNAs from PDB ID 6W6L were used as starting models for the ribosome. The TRAP complex from PDB ID 8RJC30 (mutated to human) and the OST-A complex from PDB ID 8B6L29 were used as starting models for the secretory translocon.

Initial models for the remaining translocon components (FKBP11, CCDC134 and KCP2) and the GRP94 nascent chain were generated using the ColabFold2 (ref. 76) implementation of AlphaFold2 multimer v3 (ref. 77), as described below (Extended Data Fig. 4). Protein sequences were obtained from UniProt78.

The quality of each AlphaFold2 multimer prediction was initially assessed by the predicted local-distance difference test (pLDDT), which provides a per-residue confidence score for each subunit, the predicted aligned error (PAE), which provides a confidence measure of the predicted protein–protein interface(s), and by the overall (pTM) and interface (ipTM) predicted TM scores. The AlphaFold2 complexes were also validated by their fit to the experimental density, comparison with previously determined structures and mutational analysis. Low-confidence regions not supported by the cryo-EM density were removed from the model.

All maps were used for model building. The 60S subunit, A/P and P/E tRNAs were placed as rigid bodies into Map 2 and a 43-residue poly-Ala segment of the nascent chain was modelled into exit tunnel density extending into the open SEC61 channel. The model was fit using tightly restrained real-space refinement in Coot79, including planar and trans peptide restraints, Ramachandran restraints and Geman-McClure local distance restraints.

The OST-A complex from 8B6L was placed into Map 1 as a rigid body and adjusted as a single unit using tightly restrained real-space refinement in Coot, as above. The AlphaFold2 model of KCP2 (bound to the N-terminal region of DC2) was placed into the map and adjusted as a single unit (to maintain predicted inter-chain contacts) using tightly restrained real-space refinement in Coot. Weak density in the STT3A catalytic site was visible for a co-purifying LLO ligand, including the pyrophosphate group and portions of the isoprenyl tail and glycan moiety, and was built using PDB ID 8AGC as a guide. Several ordered N-glycans were also built for STT3A and RPN1. Further weak density was visible for what are probably digitonin and lipid molecules, but these were not modelled.

The AlphaFold2 model for SEC61–RAMP4 complex was placed as a rigid body into Map 1 and the complex adjusted as a single unit using tightly restrained real-space refinement in Coot. The displaced plug region of the fully opened SEC61 channel was rebuilt using PDB ID 8RJB as a guide.

Density for the TRAP complex, which was strongest in the lumenal regions, showed substantial displacement from its canonical position adjacent to SEC61. To model this, we divided the model into three separate regions: (1) the TRAPβ,γ,δ membrane and cytosolic segments; (2) TRAPα,β,δ lumenal domains; and (3) the TRAPα TMD and cytosolic tail. The membrane and lumenal regions were fit using tightly restrained real-space refinement in Coot. The TRAPα cytosolic tail was adjusted manually and fit using real-space refinement; no density was observed for the TRAPα TMD, which was not modelled.

The FKBP11–CCDC134 AlphaFold2 model was docked into Map 1 as a rigid body. The C-terminal, positively charged helix of FKBP11 was modelled into weak density adjacent to the ribosome. The flexible C-terminus of CCDC134 was placed into helical density at the OST48–RPN2 interface, guided by an additional AlphaFold2 prediction. The resulting model was adjusted using tightly restrained real-space refinement in Coot.

The AlphaFold2 model of GRP94 (residues 22–97) bound to DC2 and STT3A was placed into Map 1 by superimposing onto the previously placed STT3A subunit. GRP94 residues 73–97 showed poor fit to the helical cryo-EM density and were removed and the three-subunit complex (including GRP94 residues 22–72) was adjusted using tightly restrained real-space refinement in Coot.

Next, the AlphaFold2 model of GRP94 (residues 22–97) bound to CCDC134 was docked into Map 1 by superimposing onto the previously placed model of CCDC134–FKBP11. GRP94 residues 63–92 are predicted by AlphaFold2 to form a single extended helix (‘bridge helix'), in excellent agreement with the experimental cryo-EM density. GRP94 residues 22–72 were removed and the two-subunit complex was adjusted using tightly restrained real-space refinement in Coot.

Finally, the globular N-domain of GRP94 was docked into low-resolution density adjacent to CCDC134. Placement was guided by the central helical element of the N-domain and its β-sheet. No density was visible in the GRP94 nucleotide binding site or for the dynamic active-site ‘lid', which was removed from the model. Similarly, no density was visible for the GRP94 ‘charged linker' motif or for the M- and C-domains. The final GRP94 model (residues 22–283) was adjusted as a single complex with CCDC134, FKBP11, DC2 and STT3A using tightly restrained real-space refinement in Coot.

The translocon model was subjected to real-space refinement in PHENIX80 alone (versus Map 1) or after combining with the 60S model (versus Map 2). Five rounds of global minimization and group B-factor refinement were carried out with Ramachandran and rotamer restraints (rotamer outliers were fixed using the fit option ‘outliers' and the target was set to ‘fix_outliers'), reference model restraints (starting model) and hydrogen-bonding, base-pair and stacking parallelity restraints applied to the rRNA. Secondary structure restraints were turned off. Final model statistics for the translocon and the 60S-translocon models are provided in Extended Data Table 1. Structure figures were generated with ChimeraX81.

RKO whole-cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer: 50 mM Tris at pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 2% NP-40, 0.25% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.5 mM TCEP, 10% glycerol, 1× SIGMAFAST protease inhibitor cocktail (MilliporeSigma) and 1× PhosSTOP phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Samples were placed on a shaker for 30 min at 4 °C, centrifuged for 30 min at 20,000 × g at 4 °C and the supernatant was collected and measured by BCA (Thermo Fisher Scientific). To resolve LRP6 and full-length GRP94 glycoforms, samples were run on Novex Tris-Glycine 4 to 12% gels (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For immunoblot analysis of IGF1R, cells were collected by scraping, as IGF1R is sensitive to trypsinization. The resolved proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad Laboratories) using a wet electroblotting system (Bio-Rad Laboratories) followed by immunoblotting.

For EndoH analysis of wild-type and knockout (ΔFKBP11, ΔCCDC134, ΔSTT3A, ΔSTT3B) HEK293 cells, microsomes were prepared from two 15-cm dishes as described above. A 20-μl aliquot (A260 of 60) was thawed and centrifuged at 10,000g for 10 min at 4 °C. The samples were treated with 2,500 U EndoH (New England Biolabs, P0702L), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Samples were run on home-made tris-glycine 5.5% gels at 4 °C and constant voltage (150 V) or on 4–20% Bio-Rad TGX precast gels, followed by immunoblotting.

For analysis of GRP94 mutants in HEK293 cells, wild-type Flp-In T-REx 293 cells were seeded onto a six-well plate at a density of 200,000 cells per well one day before transfection. A transfection mixture was prepared containing 1 μg pcDNA5-SS-3xFLAG-GRP94, 150 μl Opti-MEM and 3 μl TransIT293, which was incubated at room temperature for 20 min before adding dropwise to each well. After 24 h, cells were collected using cold 1× PBS and centrifuged at 500g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded and cells were resuspended in 100 μl lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.5 mM PMSF). Samples were incubated on ice for 15 min (with vortexing every 5 min) and the supernatant was collected after centrifugation at 20,000g for 10 min at 4 °C. Samples were analysed by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and immunoblotting.

Data are representative of at least two independent experiments. For gel source data, see Supplementary Fig. 1. c, Distribution of footprint lengths in coding regions of mRNAs. d, Reads were grouped by read lengths (18–35 nt) and the fraction of reads assigned to the three different frames is shown.

Initial rounds of 3D classification yielded four classes containing characteristic density for the secretory translocon (TRAP, SEC61 and OST-A complexes). These were subjected to further 3D refinement and focused classification with signal subtraction using a mask around the translocon, micelle and part of the ribosomal large subunit (cyan). This yielded three main secretory translocon classes, which were refined and subjected to further focused classification with signal subtraction using a mask around GRP94, CCDC134, FKBP11 and STT3A (green). The class with density for GRP94, CCDC134 and FKBP11 was refined to generate final maps of the translocon (Map 1) and the RTC (Map 2).

a, Overview of the translocon-only map (Map 1) and whole-particle map after focused refinement on the 60S subunit (Map 2), coloured and low-pass-filtered by local resolution as estimated in RELION 5.0. Maps are coloured on the same scale, from 3.5 to 9.5 Å. b, Map 1 shown at a lower contour and coloured by local resolution as in panel a. c, Fourier shell correlation (FSC) curves (masked). d, Angular distribution plot. The height and colour (blue to red) of the bars is proportional to the number of particles in those views.

All predictions were obtained using the ColabFold2 implementation of AlphaFold2 multimer v3 (ref. 77). Models are coloured by chain and by pLDDT. pTM and ipTM scores. Predicted alignment error matrices are also shown. a, FKBP11 and CCDC134. b, STT3A, DC2 and GRP94 residues 22–97. c, CCDC134 and GRP94 residues 22–97. d, STT3A, DC2 and KCP2.

a, CCDC134 (blue) and FKBP11 (purple) fit to the cryo-EM translocon map low-pass-filtered to 8-Å resolution.

The AF2 pre-N model (grey) was superimposed by means of the STT3A subunit (not shown for clarity). The correct register of the final model is supported by the clear side-chain density for several residues (for example, R39, S42, R43, T44, R51) and the excellent agreement with the AlphaFold2 model. c, Overview of CCDC134 and the GRP94 bridge helix (magenta) fit to the translocon map low-pass-filtered to 6-Å resolution. d, Orthogonal views of KCP2 (green) and the DC2 N-terminal extension (salmon) fit to the same map.

Severe clashes are observed between the M-domain (dark grey) and STT3A (green), DC2 (salmon), CCDC134 (blue) and portions of the GRP94 pre-N domain (magenta), including the bridge helix. Further clashes are observed between the C-domain and STT3A and DC2. c, Overlay of a folded GRP94 monomer (PDB ID 2o1v) in an open-dimer conformation, aligned on the N-domain of nascent GRP94. Severe clashes are observed between M-domain (rosy brown) and STT3A, CCDC134 and RPN1 (not visible in this view). Further clashes are observed between the C-domain and RPN1. FKBP11 was removed for clarity in panels b and c. d, The charged linker (CL) (red) from an AlphaFold2 model of GRP94 was superimposed onto the structure of nascent GRP94 to highlight its location at the translocon. This antiparallel two-stranded β-sheet projects away from the N-domain, where it may help shield the M- and C-domains as they begin to fold.

A research group at the City University of New York and the University of Texas at Austin has found a method to make dark excitons, a class of previously unseen light states, emit bright light and be controlled with nanoscale precision. The study, published November 12 in Nature Photonics, points toward future technologies that could operate faster, use less energy, and shrink to even smaller sizes.

Dark excitons form in ultra-thin semiconductor materials and normally remain undetectable because they release only faint light. Even so, scientists have long viewed them as promising for quantum information and advanced photonics because they interact with light in unusual ways, remain stable for relatively long periods, and experience less disruption from their surroundings, which helps reduce decoherence.

Amplifying Dark Excitons With Nanoscale Design

To bring these hidden states into view, the researchers created a tiny optical cavity built from gold nanotubes combined with a single layer of tungsten diselenide (WSe2), a material just three atoms thick. This structure increased the brightness of dark excitons by an extraordinary factor of 300,000, making them clearly observable and allowing their behavior to be precisely controlled.

"This work shows that we can access and manipulate light-matter states that were previously out of reach," said principal investigator Andrea Alù, Distinguished and Einstein Professor of Physics at the CUNY Graduate Center and founding director of the Photonics Initiative at the Advanced Science Research Center at the CUNY Graduate Center (CUNY ASRC). "By turning these hidden states on and off at will and controlling them with nanoscale resolution, we open exciting opportunities to disruptively advance next-generation optical and quantum technologies, including for sensing and computing."

Electric and Magnetic Control of Hidden Quantum States

The team also demonstrated that these dark excitons can be switched and adjusted using electric and magnetic fields. This level of control could support new designs for on-chip photonics, highly sensitive detectors, and secure quantum communication. Importantly, the method preserves the original characteristics of the material while still achieving record-setting improvements in light-matter coupling.

"Our study reveals a new family of spin-forbidden dark excitons that had never been observed before," said first author Jiamin Quan. "This discovery is just the beginning -- it opens a path to explore many other hidden quantum states in 2D materials."

Solving a Debate in Plasmonics

The findings also address a long-standing question of whether plasmonic structures can boost dark excitons without altering their fundamental nature when placed in close proximity. The researchers solved this by designing a plasmonic-excitonic heterostructure made with nanometer-thin boron nitride layers, which proved essential for revealing the newly identified dark excitons.

Precise genome-editing technologies such as base editing1,2 and prime editing3 can correct most pathogenic gene variants, but their widespread clinical application is impeded by the need to develop new therapeutic agents for each mutation. For diseases that are caused by premature stop codons, suppressor tRNAs (sup-tRNAs) offer a more general strategy. Existing approaches to use sup-tRNAs therapeutically, however, require lifelong administration4,5 or show modest potency, necessitating potentially toxic overexpression. Here we present prime editing-mediated readthrough of premature termination codons (PERT), a strategy to rescue nonsense mutations in a disease-agnostic manner by using prime editing to permanently convert a dispensable endogenous tRNA into an optimized sup-tRNA. Iterative screening of thousands of variants of all 418 human tRNAs identified tRNAs with the strongest sup-tRNA potential. We optimized prime editing agents to install an engineered sup-tRNA at a single genomic locus without overexpression and observed efficient readthrough of premature termination codons and protein rescue in human cell models of Batten disease, Tay–Sachs disease and cystic fibrosis. In vivo delivery of a single prime editor that converts an endogenous mouse tRNA into a sup-tRNA extensively rescued disease pathology in a model of Hurler syndrome. PERT did not induce detected readthrough of natural stop codons or cause significant transcriptomic or proteomic changes. Our findings suggest the potential of disease-agnostic therapeutic genome-editing approaches that require only a single composition of matter to treat diverse genetic diseases.

Therapeutic genome-editing efforts, including more than 70 clinical trials so far, have predominantly used programmable nucleases, base editors or prime editors to disrupt or correct disease-associated genes in an allele-specific manner. These approaches have proven to be effective in patients or in animal models for the treatment of disorders such as sickle-cell disease6,7, T cell leukaemia8, hypercholesterolaemia9,10, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency10, chronic granulomatous disease11, progeria12, spinal muscular atrophy13, prion disease14, alternating hemiplaegia of childhood15 and many other genetic diseases.

Although allele-specific therapeutic genome-editing strategies offer treatments for many serious diseases with few treatment options, the breadth of the global genetic disease crisis, in which more than 8,000 genetic diseases collectively affect hundreds of millions of patients, demands new approaches that more rapidly bring the benefits of therapeutic genome editing to large numbers of patients16. Allele-specific applications of nucleases, base editors and prime editors require the development of a distinct genome-editing treatment for each of the more than 200,000 known pathogenic mutations, although prime editing also enables corrections of clustered hotspots of mutations. Until substantial streamlining of regulatory, development and manufacturing costs occurs, the development of the thousands of distinct drugs needed to treat any large fraction of patients with genetic disease remains impractical, despite the fact that base editing and prime editing can collectively correct the vast majority of known pathogenic mutations1,2,3.

The versatility of prime editing, which uses a programmable nickase and a reverse transcriptase to replace targeted segments of DNA with new sequences of our choosing3, can be used in creative ways that may benefit far larger cross-sections of patients with genetic disease. Nonsense mutations account for 24% of pathogenic alleles in the ClinVar database16. The common molecular consequence of nonsense mutations—termination of translation before functional protein can be made—suggests more generalized approaches to their therapeutic rescue that might be applied in an allele-agnostic or even disease-agnostic manner.

Nonsense sup-tRNAs have an anticodon that complements a premature termination codon (PTC) and support the installation of an amino acid rather than termination of translation. Although sup-tRNAs can theoretically read through both PTCs and natural termination codons (NTCs), extensive evidence suggests that sup-tRNAs can be well-tolerated in eukaryotes. Both naturally occurring and exogenous sup-tRNAs can be expressed without apparent toxicity4,5. Multiple biological mechanisms explain the observation of surprisingly low levels of sup-tRNA-mediated readthrough at NTCs. First, the distribution of stop codons for PTCs is distinct from the distribution for NTCs, particularly increasing the safety profile of sup-tRNAs corresponding to the amber stop codon (TAG)17. Second, the frequent presence of redundant and diverse in-frame stop codons following NTCs reduces the likelihood of extending a protein past a suppressed stop codon by more than a few amino acids18. Third, recruitment of polypeptide chain release factors to the 3′ untranslated region (3′ UTR) near NTCs can outcompete sup-tRNAs19. Fourth, if the ribosome continues past the NTC, the RNA and protein are targeted for degradation through the non-stop decay pathway20, and proteins that are translated into the 3′ UTR are further recognized and targeted for degradation21. Finally, sup-tRNAs mediate nonsense suppression only in transcripts that are being expressed in a given cell, minimizing the risk of toxicity from ectopic overexpression.

Despite the promise of sup-tRNAs as a potential therapeutic strategy, current approaches such as lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-based or adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated delivery of sup-tRNAs4,5 face the challenge of supporting sup-tRNA production throughout the lifetime of the patient. AAV-based methods, in particular, may be limited to a single dose, owing to the generation of high levels of neutralizing antibodies following dosing, which may not be sufficient to treat genetic diseases that require restoration of protein expression for the lifetime of the patient. In addition, efforts to apply sup-tRNAs as therapeutic agents are stymied by a lack of complete understanding of the determinants of sup-tRNA potency. As a result, recent efforts to rescue nonsense mutations have relied on the overexpression or delivery of high levels of sup-tRNAs with suboptimal suppression efficiency4,5, even though tRNA overexpression can alter global translation22,23,24 and raise the possibility of toxicity. A one-time treatment that would enable permanent expression of endogenous levels of a sup-tRNA optimized for suppression efficiency without apparent toxicity has the potential to transform the treatment of diseases caused by PTCs. Because such a treatment may ameliorate a variety of diseases arising from the targeted type of stop codon, it also has the potential to benefit a large number of patients with multiple disorders caused by many pathogenic PTCs.

Here we evaluated tens of thousands of variants of all 418 high-confidence human tRNAs to engineer highly active sup-tRNAs with sufficient potency to mediate efficient nonsense mutation suppression even when expressed from a single genomic copy with endogenous regulatory elements. By iteratively optimizing: (1) the 40-bp leader sequence of the tRNAs; (2) the tRNA sequence via saturation mutagenesis; and (3) the terminator sequence of the tRNAs, we developed a highly active TAG-targeting sup-tRNA despite its expression remaining at sub-endogenous levels from a single genomic locus. We then used the versatility of prime editing to permanently convert a redundant endogenous human tRNA to these optimized sup-tRNAs. We call this strategy PERT (prime editing-mediated readthrough of premature termination codons).

In human cell models of nonsense mutations in genes known to cause Batten disease (TPP1 p.L211X and TPP1 p.L527X), Tay–Sachs disease (HEXA p.L273X and HEXA p.L274X) and Niemann–Pick disease type C1 (NPC1 p.Q421X and NPC1 p.Y423X), treatment with the same prime editor programmed to install an optimized sup-tRNA resulted in restoration of 20–70% of normal enzyme activity. We experimentally quantified the effectiveness of our prime editing-installed sup-tRNA for reading through all clinically relevant TAG PTCs in the ClinVar database, observing PTC readthrough for the vast majority of sequences tested. Finally, we applied PERT in vivo in a mouse with a co-delivered reporter construct containing a nonsense mutation in GFP, as well as in a mouse model of Hurler syndrome, a severe lysosomal storage disease caused by a premature stop codon (IDUA p.W392X). Treatment with a single composition of matter mediated around 25% production of full-length GFP in reporter mice, and therapeutic levels of approximately 6% IDUA enzyme activity restoration, resulting in nearly complete rescue of disease pathology in Hurler syndrome mice. These findings provide a foundation for the development of disease-agnostic therapeutic genome-editing strategies that have the potential to substantially increase the number of patients that can benefit from a single genome-editing drug.

The human genome encodes 47 isodecoder (anticodon) tRNA families comprising 418 high-confidence genes (Supplementary Table 1). This redundancy, coupled with transcription-induced mutagenesis, yields many tolerated tRNA mutations in humans, including anticodon mutations that create natural suppressor or mis-charged tRNAs25,26. Fourteen isodecoder families have no corresponding tRNA gene and are decoded by pseudocognate tRNAs27, and entire tRNA families have been deleted without consequence28. Therefore, we hypothesized that converting a single endogenous tRNA to a sup-tRNA with prime editing could be well-tolerated and enable readthrough of nonsense mutations regardless of the gene in which they originate. This approach avoids tRNA overexpression that can perturb global translation22,23,24 and preserves native tRNA regulation.

To screen endogenous human tRNAs for their ability to become sup-tRNAs, we designed mCherry-STOP-GFP reporters in which GFP expression occurs only after PTC readthrough (Supplementary Fig. 1a–e and Methods). Next, we designed prime editing reagents to convert the anticodon loops of two endogenous tRNAs (tRNA-Gln-CTG-6-1 and tRNA-Arg-CCG-2-1) into sup-tRNAs. For clarity, we follow standard tRNA nomenclature throughout this work. For example, in tRNA-Gln-CTG-6-1: Gln indicates the associated amino acid; CTG indicates the anticodon; 6 is the isodecoder index that distinguishes tRNA genes in the same family with minor sequence differences; and 1 is the locus copy number (Extended Data Fig. 1a).

We installed these sup-tRNAs at the endogenous loci of tRNA-Gln-CTG-6-1 and tRNA-Arg-CCG-2-1 using prime editing in HEK293T cells. We observed on average 29% conversion of each endogenous tRNA into a sup-tRNA (range: 19%–37%) (Extended Data Fig. 1b). We then overexpressed the reporter construct via plasmid transfection, or expressed it from a single gene copy using lentiviral transduction. We characterized PTC readthrough using two metrics: the percentage of GFP-positive cells (% GFP) and the GFP mean fluorescence intensity relative to a wild-type GFP control (relative protein yield) (Extended Data Fig. 1c). Although both sup-tRNAs led to GFP rescue with an overexpressed reporter, neither led to significant PTC readthrough with a single-copy reporter (Extended Data Fig. 1d). Even with an overexpressed reporter, the per cent rescue of GFP relative to a wild-type control was modest, with on average 7.8% GFP-positive cells and a relative GFP protein yield of 10%, and overexpression of the reporter alone without any sup-tRNA yielded 3.9% GFP-positive cells, presumably from pseudocognate tRNA-mediated PTC readthrough.

Previous sup-tRNA studies have heavily relied on high tRNA levels in transfection, LNP or viral settings, often using elevated copy numbers of the sup-tRNA and/or the PTC-containing mRNA4,5. These findings revealed the need to identify sup-tRNAs that are sufficiently potent to mediate endogenous genomic PTC readthrough at low sup-tRNA levels that are compatible with genomic installation and minimize the risk of perturbing global translation.

To comprehensively identify sup-tRNAs that promote stop codon readthrough with low copy number expression, we designed three prime editing screens to convert the anticodon of each endogenous human tRNA (n = 418 genes) to CUA, UCA, or UUA anticodons, thereby generating sup-tRNAs that recognize TAG, TGA or TAA stop codons, respectively (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 2). For each tRNA gene, we identified the two nearest 20-bp spacers flanking the anticodon with an NGG protospacer-adjacent motif and varied primer-binding site (PBS) lengths (11–14 bp) and reverse transcription template (RTT) homology lengths (6–10 bp), where feasible. To enhance editing efficiency, we appended the structured RNA motif tevopreQ1 to each prime editing guide RNA (pegRNA), creating engineered pegRNAs (epegRNAs)29. In total, we designed 17,579 epegRNAs for each of the three sup-tRNA anticodons plus 420 negative-control epegRNAs (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table 2).

We cloned the epegRNA libraries into a lentiviral backbone and transduced them into a corresponding HEK293T cell line containing the mCherry-STOP-GFP reporter. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) isolation of GFP-positive cells enriched cells expressing epegRNAs that generate functional sup-tRNAs (Fig. 1b,c and Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4). We identified arginine, leucine, tyrosine and serine tRNA backbones capable of reading through TAG stop codons (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 2a–f) and leucine and arginine tRNA backbones that read through TGA stop codons (Extended Data Fig. 3a–d and Supplementary Fig. 5). A similar screen for TAA stop codons did not yield effective sup-tRNAs (Supplementary Fig. 6), consistent with previous observations that TAA is the most stringent stop codon and is more resistant to sup-tRNA-mediated readthrough30.

Whereas epegRNAs that simultaneously targeted multiple tRNA sequences generally performed best, half of the most enriched positive hits in the TAG screen were epegRNAs targeting a single tRNA (Extended Data Fig. 2b–d). Although the epegRNA screen successfully identified endogenous tRNAs that could be converted into effective sup-tRNAs, even the best-performing sup-tRNA from this screen achieved less than 5% protein yield relative to a wild-type GFP control (Extended Data Fig. 2b). To address this limitation, we next engineered all major features of each sup-tRNA to enhance readthrough efficiencies.

A eukaryotic tRNA gene contains three distinct elements: the leader sequence, the tRNA gene body and the termination sequence (Extended Data Fig. 4a). Whereas tRNA expression is typically driven by an internal Pol III promoter, the leader sequence is thought to regulate gene expression31. Thus far, most sup-tRNA studies have relied on exogenous promoters for expression5, although the role of internal tRNA promoters is being investigated32.

To test tRNA promoter variants, we designed single-copy lentiviral constructs with: (1) an exogenous human U6 promoter (hU6); (2) a minimal human U6 promoter lacking the nucleosome positioning element (minU6)33; or (3) no exogenous promoter (Extended Data Fig. 4b). We performed three screens using a pool of all 418 mature tRNA sequences, modifying their anticodons to CUA, UCA or UUA to target TAG, TGA or TAA stop codons, respectively. The pooled sup-tRNA libraries were cloned into lentiviral constructs with each promoter variant and transduced into the mCherry-STOP-GFP reporter lines (Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 3).

Unlike the prime editing screen, lentiviral expression of sup-tRNAs with exogenous promoters yielded fewer TAG sup-tRNAs and activity depended on promoter choice (Extended Data Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 7a). Leu-TAA sup-tRNAs were strongest with hU6 (tRNA-Leu-TAA-4-1, tRNA-Leu-TAA-3-1, tRNA-Leu-TAA-1-1 and tRNA-Leu-TAA-2-1, in descending order of activity), whereas Tyr-GTA (tRNA-Tyr-GTA-7-1) performed best with minU6 or no promoter, suggesting that this tRNA may have stronger internal promoter elements (Extended Data Fig. 4c). No effective TGA sup-tRNAs were identified when expressing the sup-tRNAs from a lentiviral construct (Supplementary Fig. 7b). Since exogenous promoters seem to hinder the proper expression of many sup-tRNAs identified in the prime editing screen, we next sought to investigate how endogenous leader sequences and terminator sequences affect sup-tRNA function.

To further evaluate the effect of leader sequences, we analysed the 40 bp upstream of all 418 high-confidence human tRNAs. These sequences are less conserved than the tRNA gene bodies and may influence their expression31,32. We cloned each leader sequence upstream of a sup-tRNA candidate (tRNA-Leu-TAA-3-1) (Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 4), transduced this pool of constructs into the mCherry-STOP-GFP reporter cell line, and isolated GFP-positive cells via FACS. Eighty-six per cent of the cells expressing a sup-tRNA in this screen were GFP-positive, indicating that most leader sequences support sup-tRNA expression (Extended Data Fig. 4d). We individually tested leader sequences with the highest and lowest enrichment among GFP-positive cells, as well as eight randomly generated control sequences. The top hits performed well (averaging 72% GFP-positive cells) and the bottom hits performed poorly (averaging 6.1% GFP-positive cells), but the random leader controls also performed reasonably well (averaging 57% GFP-positive cells) (Extended Data Fig. 4e). Thus, whereas many diverse leader sequences can support robust sup-tRNA activity, others can nearly abolish activity. No apparent leader consensus sequences explained the observed variation in sup-tRNA activity.

Next, we investigated whether leader sequences could modulate PTC suppression levels across different sup-tRNAs. We selected six types of leader sequences: (1) each tRNA's own endogenous leader; (2) a top-performing leader (Top-6); (3) a bottom-performing leader (Bottom-6); (4) a random leader (Random-4) (Extended Data Fig. 4e); and two leaders upstream of highly expressed tRNAs: (5) tRNA-Cys-GCA-3-1; and (6) tRNA-Ser-GCT-3-1, which could in principle be overwritten with alternative sup-tRNA sequences using prime editing34. In parallel, we explored how downstream termination sequences might affect tRNA expression levels. We identified four potential downstream sequences to test: the endogenous 100-bp sequence downstream of each mature tRNA sequence, and terminators consisting of TTT (3T), TTTT (4T) or TTTTT (5T), which are predicted to terminate transcription from a Pol III promoter with efficiencies of approximately 0%, 75% or 99%, respectively35.

We generated a lentiviral library containing all 6 leader sequences paired with 418 human tRNAs with their anticodons switched to CUA, UCA or UUA. We also assessed the effect of each of the 4 tested terminators placed downstream of sup-tRNAs paired with their endogenous leader sequences, with a total of 11,543 combinations of leader, sup-tRNA and terminator sequences (Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 5). We transduced each reporter cell line with the lentiviral library, isolated GFP-positive cells and sequenced the enriched tRNA variants. Unlike the lentiviral screening with exogenous promoters, this screen successfully identified at least one variant of all TAG sup-tRNAs that had been identified in the prime editing screen. The most effective sup-tRNAs performed best when paired with their own endogenous leader sequence (Extended Data Fig. 4f). Thus leader sequences have a critical regulatory role in tRNA activity.

The screen results also indicated that a terminator is essential for sup-tRNA activity, with a directly adjacent 5T terminator outperforming most endogenous terminator sequences (Extended Data Fig. 4g). We hypothesize that the absence of a terminator may lead to run-off of Pol III, or weakened expression due to a lack of the traditional Pol III recycling mechanism in which Pol III is rapidly reused for a new round of transcription after completing a transcript36. Notably, only 93% and 48% of natural downstream sequences have a 4T or 5T termination sequence, respectively, within 100 bp of their mature tRNA sequence37 (Supplementary Fig. 8a,b).

We next hypothesized that introducing mutations within the tRNA itself could further enhance sup-tRNA activity. We also sought to identify silent mutations that could improve prime editing outcomes by evading cellular mismatch repair (MMR)38 and by preventing rebinding of the prime editor to the target tRNA locus following repair. We selected three candidate sup-tRNAs (tRNA-Arg-CCT-4-1, tRNA-Tyr-GTA-2-1 and tRNA-Leu-TAA-4-1) and a corresponding mouse sup-tRNA (tRNA-Leu-TAA-2-1) and generated lentiviral libraries that include every possible 1-bp deletion, single-nucleotide substitution variant (SNV), and simultaneous base pair substitution in each tRNA's paired bases (Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 6).

We transduced the reporter cell line with these lentiviral libraries and compared their performance to that of the corresponding anticodon-only (ac-only) sup-tRNA sequences. Most mutations reduced sup-tRNA performance (Extended Data Fig. 4h). Deletions were poorly tolerated across sup-tRNAs (Extended Data Fig. 5a). By contrast, for each sup-tRNA, a subset of SNVs and paired-base substitutions improved sup-tRNA performance (Extended Data Fig. 4h). We also found that beneficial mutations in tRNA-Leu-TAA-4-1 could apply to the related family members tRNA-Leu-TAA-1-1, tRNA-Leu-TAA-2-1, and tRNA-Leu-TAA-3-1 (Extended Data Fig. 5b, Supplementary Fig. 9 and Supplementary Table 7).

Since the tRNA-Leu-TAA family exhibited the highest baseline suppression activity, we selected this sup-tRNA backbone for further engineering (Fig. 2a,b). We focused on the mutations that were capable of being introduced at the same time as anticodon conversion with prime editing. Since mutations in sup-tRNAs can have additive effects4,32, we generated 19 combinations of the 5 anticodon-proximal mutations and introduced them into the top-performing tRNA-Leu-TAA-1-1 sup-tRNA using either prime editing at the endogenous locus or by expressing the variant from a single-copy lentiviral construct (Fig. 2c). For clarity, we refer to tRNAs whose anticodon alone was replaced as ac-only sup-tRNAs. When additional mutations were introduced to enhance readthrough, we designate them engineered sup-tRNAs and specify the type of mutation introduced; for example, engineered sup-tRNA (tRNA-Leu-TAA-1-1+hp12ta>cg+hp13gc>cg).

The Leu-ss94-tStem9 variant is the engineered mature tRNA sequence converted to a TAG suppressor, flanked by the immediate 55-bp leader sequence of the tRNA-Cys-GCA-12-1 gene and the 35-bp trailer sequence of the tRNA-Ile-TAT-1-1 gene. The number of bases from the nearest endogenous tRNA are indicated. Data are mean ± s.d. of n = 2 independent biological replicates.

Of note, we observed that sup-tRNA mutations can be additively combined, supporting the production of up to fivefold higher levels of full-length GFP protein than the ac-only sup-tRNA, yielding up to 35% of the amount of GFP as control cells expressing an uninterrupted GFP gene (Fig. 2d, Extended Data Fig. 5d and Supplementary Table 8). Engineered sup-tRNAs developed in this study substantially outperform previously engineered sup-tRNAs, including a recently reported variant that yielded 16% GFP protein yield (Fig. 2d) but would require changing 83 bp of a native tRNA sequence for genomic installation32. By contrast, the best-performing variants we engineered require the substitution of only 6 bp from the wild-type tRNA-Leu-TAA-1-1 gene sequence.

To evaluate the cellular abundance of prime editing-installed sup-tRNAs compared with a wild-type endogenous tRNA, we performed targeted tRNA sequencing for tRNA-Leu-TAA-1-1 on a polyclonal edited population. By comparing the installation efficiency of each sup-tRNA at the DNA level with the frequency of corresponding tRNA-sequencing reads at the RNA level, we inferred the relative abundance of prime editing-installed sup-tRNAs versus the wild-type tRNA at the same genomic locus. We observed that the ac-only sup-tRNA and the engineered sup-tRNA are 5.6-fold and 2.5-fold less abundant, respectively, than the endogenous tRNA-Leu-TAA-1-1 that they replace (Extended Data Fig. 6a). Introducing mutations in the anticodon stem thus increased the abundance of the engineered sup-tRNA compared with the ac-only sup-tRNA (Extended Data Fig. 6a). Both sup-tRNAs were modified at positions 26 and 37, as expected39 (Extended Data Fig. 6b–e). These findings suggest that mutations in the anticodon stem can increase engineered sup-tRNA performance in part by increasing its cellular abundance.

Encouraged by the greatly enhanced suppression efficiency achieved through iterative engineering of the mature tRNA sequence, we next optimized prime editing strategies to convert the mammalian endogenous tRNA-Leu-TAA-1-1 tRNA gene into the ac-only sup-tRNA or engineered sup-tRNA. We designed a lentiviral epegRNA library of 17,280 epegRNAs that exhaustively tested spacer variants, PBS lengths from 8 to 16 bp, RTT lengths from 21 to 36 bp, and combinations of each of the 19 mutation variants of interest alongside 720 control epegRNAs (Fig. 3a). We encoded a tRNA-Leu-TAA-1-1 synthetic target site directly adjacent to the lentiviral epegRNA to read out both the epegRNA and the outcome of editing in the same sequencing read, transfected cells transduced with this library with a panel of plasmids encoding prime editor proteins40 (PE6a, PE6b, PE6c, PE6d, PE6e, PE6f, PE6g, PEmax and PEmaxΔRNaseH) (Fig. 3a,b and Supplementary Tables 9 and 10), and evaluated editing at the synthetic target site using sequencing. Furthermore, we performed experiments in both MMR-deficient (HEK293T) cells and MMR-proficient (HeLa) cells and included conditions in which MMR was transiently inhibited by co-transfection of a dominant-negative MMR protein (MLH1dn)38.

Across all conditions tested, PE6c yielded the highest mean editing efficiency (Fig. 3b). The mutation combination of hp12ta>cg+hp14gc>ta+mut38a>t yielded the highest mean editing of 24% (Extended Data Fig. 7a) and the inclusion of MLH1dn resulted in greater mean editing efficiencies for most tested variants, suggesting that MMR evasion strategies can enhance editing efficiency for these edits (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 7c). We observed a high correlation (R = 0.78) between the results from the HeLa and HEK293T datasets (Extended Data Fig. 7d and Supplementary Discussion).

To validate that editing of the lentivirally integrated target site used in the screen reflects editing of the endogenous tRNA-Leu-TAA-1-1 locus, we performed arrayed validation on 122 high-performing and low-performing epegRNAs in HEK293T and HeLa cells. Editing efficiency at the endogenous locus and at the lentiviral target site in both cell types were correlated (Fig. 3d,e, R = 0.80 in HEK293T cells and R = 0.70 in HeLa cells), indicating that the lentiviral target-matched screen reflects prime editing outcomes at the endogenous locus.

On the basis of the optimized editing results and the readthrough efficacy data, we selected two variant combinations to advance: hp13gc>ta+hp12ta>cg and hp13gc>cg+hp12ta>cg. To finalize our editing strategy, we tested whether a PE3 or PE3b strategy—both of which use a nicking guide RNA (ngRNA) to nick the unedited strand of the heteroduplex editing intermediate in order to favour the use of the edited strand as a template for DNA repair—could further improve editing outcomes3. Top-performing PE3 strategies yielded mean editing efficiencies of ~60–80% in HEK293T cells, substantially outperforming earlier designs that yielded <8% editing and completing the optimization of the proof-of-concept editing strategy for PERT (Supplementary Fig. 8c and Extended Data Fig. 7e).

We assessed off-target editing from PERT using two independent methods. First, we identified all sites in the human genome with up to four mismatches from the protospacer of the best-performing engineered sup-tRNA (Extended Data Fig. 8a). We sequenced at depth each of these sites following prime editing to install an engineered sup-tRNA (tRNA-Leu-TAA-1-1+hp12ta>cg+hp13gc>cg) and no significant off-target editing was observed above that of an untreated control (Extended Data Fig. 8b).

Second, as a genome-wide unbiased method for detecting potential off-target edits, we performed a screen in mammalian cells with a large pool of lentiviral integrated putative off-target sites. We computationally identified off-target sites in the genome with up to 6 mismatches from the optimized epegRNA's protospacer or with up to 4 mismatches and up to two bulges, identifying 17,206 candidates (Supplementary Table 11). This coverage is identical to the computational filtering step of circularization for in vitro reporting of cleavage effects by sequencing (CIRCLE-seq)41, a commonly used genome-wide off-target detection method for RNA-guided nucleases. Following lentiviral integration of the pool of off-target candidate sites and transfection to install an engineered sup-tRNA (tRNA-Leu-TAA-1-1+hp12ta>cg+hp13gc>cg) with prime editing, we sequenced the lentiviral cassette and analysed editing at each off-target site.

This analysis nominated 16 candidate off-target sites with potential prime editing events occurring above the level of the untreated control sample in prime-edited cells (Extended Data Fig. 8c). To further investigate these potential off-target sites, we individually amplified the genomic region corresponding to each of the 16 nominated off-target sites in cells transfected with prime editing reagents to install an engineered sup-tRNA (tRNA-Leu-TAA-1-1+hp12ta>cg+hp13gc>cg). We observed no off-target prime editing or indel formation above background for all amplified genomic loci (Extended Data Fig. 8d). These data are consistent with previous reports of the high sequence specificity of prime editing, which probably arises from its mechanism requiring multiple independent DNA or RNA hybridization events in order to make a productive edit3,42,43.

We evaluated the potential for several types of abnormalities in human cells following conversion of an endogenous tRNA into a sup-tRNA. To detect transcriptome perturbations, we performed RNA-seq after converting the endogenous tRNA-Leu-TAA-1-1 gene into an engineered sup-tRNA (Leu-TAA-1-1+hp12ta>cg+hp13gc>cg) with prime editing. We observed no differentially expressed genes (FDR < 0.05 and |log2(fold change)| > 1), suggesting no evident stress response from converting the tRNA-Leu-TAA-1-1 tRNA gene into a sup-tRNA gene in a human cell line (Extended Data Fig. 8e).

Next, we evaluated the effect of repurposing the tRNA-Leu-TAA-1-1 tRNA gene on global tRNA homeostasis by performing quantitative PCR to measure the pooled expression of 28 different tRNA gene families following prime editing-mediated installation of an ac-only or engineered sup-tRNA (Leu-TAA-1-1+hp12ta>cg+hp13gc>cg). We observed no significant difference (adjusted P value > 0.05) in the expression of any of these 28 tRNA gene families in either treatment condition relative to wild-type cells (Extended Data Fig. 8f), suggesting that the tRNA-Leu-TAA-1-1 tRNA gene can be repurposed without significant perturbation to general tRNA homeostasis.

To evaluate potential readthrough of NTCs, we performed mass spectrometry to detect peptides that are translated into the 3′ UTR for protein-coding genes terminating with a TAG stop codon. After confirming that Leu-TAA sup-tRNAs retain 100% fidelity of leucine charging (Extended Data Fig. 9a), we computationally predicted all peptides that could be generated by reading through the 4,036 natural TAG termination codons and extending translation to the second in-frame stop codon. We then examined whether these predicted peptides were present by performing label-free quantitative mass spectrometry on trypsin-digested total protein lysates from both control and prime-edited HEK293T cells expressing and mCherry-STOP-GFP reporter and either the ac-only sup-tRNA or the engineered sup-tRNA (Leu-TAA-1-1+hp12ta>cg+hp13gc>cg).

At the global protein abundance level, the only protein that was significantly (adjusted P value < 0.05, more than 2-fold change) different in abundance between control samples and prime-edited samples was the reporter GFP, which was 8.1-fold and 7.3-fold more abundant in cells edited with the ac-only sup-tRNA and the engineered sup-tRNA, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 9b–d and Supplementary Tables 12 and 13). Although we observed robust readthrough of the PTC and peptides generated for GFP, we detected no peptides from translation past the NTC for any TAG-terminated protein (Fig. 4a,b and Extended Data Fig. 9e).

To test with enhanced sensitivity the ability of a prime editing-installed sup-tRNA to induce NTC readthrough, we identified the 69 most abundant proteins that use a TAG stop codon from the above dataset and performed target-ion mass spectrometry to detect each of 111 predicted peptides that would be generated from reading past the NTC for these highly expressed proteins. We observed a single peptide corresponding to potential readthrough of an NTC (encoding 18 amino acids after the end of the tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase protein), but the abundance of this peptide was not significantly different (adjusted P value > 0.05) between untreated cells and cells that were prime edited to express a sup-tRNA (Extended Data Fig. 9f,g and Supplementary Table 14). Thus both proteome-wide and target-ion protein mass spectroscopy indicate that prime editing-installed sup-tRNAs do not broadly perturb the proteome or induce detected NTC readthrough under the conditions tested, probably owing to cellular mechanisms that safeguard against NTC readthrough.

Several factors influence readthrough efficiency at a given PTC with a sup-tRNA, including the expression level of the PTC-containing transcript and the nucleotide context surrounding the PTC44. To assess the potential of PERT to rescue the effects of genomic PTCs with disease relevance, we evaluated readthrough across diverse, endogenously encoded PTCs. We generated models in HEK293T cells of known human pathogenic PTCs corresponding to a TAG stop codon in TPP1, HEXA and NPC1 genes that cause Batten disease, Tay–Sachs disease and Niemann–Pick disease type C1, respectively. We chose six mutations that either originally encoded a leucine amino acid or are known to tolerate a leucine at the indicated position (TPP1 p.L211X, TPP1 p.L527X, HEXA p.L273X, HEXA p.L274X, NPC1 p.Q421X and NPC1 p.Y423X)45. As with many loss-of-function genetic diseases, previous studies suggest that even low levels of protein activity for these disorders can provide therapeutic benefits46,47,48.

We transfected these six cell models with the same optimized PE3 editing components to convert the endogenous genomic tRNA-Leu-TAA-1-1 locus into an ac-only sup-tRNA or engineered sup-tRNAs (tRNA-Leu-TAA-1-1+hp13gc>ta+hp12ta>cg or tRNA-Leu-TAA-1-1+hp13gc>cg+hp12ta>cg). At 3 d after transfection, mean editing efficiencies ranged from 67–80% for installation of the ac-only sup-tRNA, 56–84% for tRNA-Leu-TAA-1-1+hp13gc>ta+hp12ta>cg and 64–83% for tRNA-Leu-TAA-1-1+hp13gc>cg+hp12ta>cg (Fig. 4c, Supplementary Fig. 10a and Supplementary Fig. 12). Engineered sup-tRNA installation led to substantial (17–70%) restoration of enzyme activity in the four TPP1 and HEXA pathogenic PTC models, and partial restoration of full-length protein expression in both models of PTCs in NPC1 (which encodes a cholesterol transporter rather than an enzyme) using the same prime editing reagents, establishing the disease-agnostic therapeutic potential of this approach (Fig. 4b–d, Extended Data Fig. 10b–d and Supplementary Fig. 13). In each case, treatment resulted in full-length protein expression that meets or exceeds the documented therapeutic threshold for each disease target46,47,48. Together, these results establish that a single prime editing agent to convert an endogenous genomic tRNA gene into a sup-tRNA can rescue a substantial fraction of enzyme activity and full-length protein production lost to nonsense mutations.

To evaluate the performance of PERT at a broad spectrum of nonsense mutations, we cloned 14,746 pathogenic PTCs in the ClinVar database flanked on either side by the 18 nucleotides present in the native mRNA sequence into a nonsense-mediated decay-sensitive reporter construct (Supplementary Fig. 11a,b, Supplementary Fig. 14 and Supplementary Table 15). Transcripts with PTCs are often destroyed by nonsense-mediated decay during the pioneer round of translation49; however, if the PTC is read through, the transcript will be stabilized for the remainder of its lifetime. This phenomenon allows quantification of the ability of a sup-tRNA to read through a given PTC by comparing the abundance of mRNA transcripts for each PTC-containing sequence (Methods). We transduced this library of PTC-containing sequences into a clonal ac-only sup-tRNA cell line and observed an average readthrough score of 69 ± 30% across 14,746 pathogenic PTCs, indicating stabilization of the mRNA transcript and readthrough of the PTC for most sequences. We independently confirmed readthrough of full-length CFTR cDNAs containing 15 distinct pathogenic PTC mutations that cause cystic fibrosis using a prime editing-installed ac-only sup-tRNA. Protein yields across the variants were moderately correlated (R = 0.49) with the readthrough scores measured in the pooled ClinVar screen (Supplementary Fig. 11c,d and Supplementary Table 16), with a maximum observed protein yield of 14% relative to wild-type CFTR. Together, these results demonstrate that PERT can effectively rescue diverse pathogenic genomic PTCs and can be used to generate therapeutically relevant levels of full-length protein and active enzymes in human cells.

Next, we sought to evaluate the feasibility of applying PERT to rescue full-length protein production in vivo. We optimized prime editing agents to target mouse tRNA-Leu-TAA-2-1, the mouse equivalent of human tRNA-Leu-TAA-1-1, to first generate an ac-only sup-tRNA (mouse tRNA-Leu-TAA-2-1) (Supplementary Fig. 15a–f, Supplementary Discussion and Methods). We packaged prime editing agents to install the ac-only sup-tRNA using the v3em dual-AAV9 architecture50. We then designed an AAV9 eGFP reporter cassette containing a premature stop codon that only yields fluorescence when read through by a sup-tRNA. We administered these three AAV9 vectors, two for prime editing and one for the eGFP reporter, via intracerebroventricular injection into wild-type C57/BL6 mice on postnatal day 0 (P0) and evaluated prime editing and readthrough efficiency (Fig. 5a). Whereas all sup-tRNA engineering was done with a TAG sup-tRNA, for this experiment we additionally tested the installation of an analogous TGA sup-tRNA with a TGA-containing eGFP reporter construct.

Source Data

At 3 weeks after injection, we collected the brain tissue for analysis of editing and readthrough efficiency. We observed an average editing efficiency of 11% for the TAG sup-tRNA and 23% for the TGA sup-tRNA in the bulk brain cortex of treated mice (Extended Data Fig. 10a). To measure readthrough efficacy, we dissociated the cells from whole hemisphere halves of treated mice and measured GFP expression by flow cytometry. We observed an average relative protein yield of 24% of the co-delivered TAG GFP reporter and 26% of the co-delivered TGA GFP reporter (Fig. 5b). Therefore, although editing efficiency would benefit from further optimization in mice, cells that receive prime editing agents can achieve readthrough levels that could ameliorate many diseases.

To assess the tolerability of PERT in vivo, we performed whole-proteome mass spectrometry on tissues that had been prime edited to express an ac-only sup-tRNA. Similar to our observations in human cell lines (Fig. 4a,b), we did not detect any peptides corresponding to readthrough of natural stop codons in tissues from mice treated with PERT (Supplementary Table 17). In addition, we monitored a separate cohort of mice over the course of 15 weeks and observed no significant difference in body weight in the PERT-treated mice (n = 7) relative to untreated controls (n = 9) (Extended Data Fig. 10b,c).

Finally, we investigated the in vivo therapeutic application of PERT in a mouse model of the human lysosomal storage disease mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS-I). MPS-1 is caused by a lack of α-L-iduronidase, leading to the pathogenic accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). This model harbours a TAG stop codon, Idua p.W392X, which is orthologous to the most common pathogenic human mutation, IDUA p.W402X, and has been used previously to evaluate PTC readthrough in vivo5,51. For this experiment we further engineered the mouse sup-tRNA using mutations identified via saturation mutagenesis screening of mouse tRNA-Leu-TAA-2-1, generating an engineered sup-tRNA (mouse tRNA-Leu-TAA-2-1+hp13gc>ta+mut38a>t) (Supplementary Fig. 15 and Supplementary Discussion).

We packaged prime editing agents to install this sup-tRNA into the v3em dual-AAV9 architecture50 and treated homozygous and heterozygous P0 neonatal IduaW392X littermates via intracerebroventricular injection (Fig. 5c). At 7 weeks after treatment, we evaluated prime editing efficiencies across tissues and observed mean desired prime editing efficiencies of 6.3%, 6.1%, 6.8% and 0.05% in the cortex, heart, liver and kidney, respectively (Fig. 5d), consistent with the known tissue tropism of AAV9 (ref. 52). Editing led to marked restoration of IDUA enzymatic activity compared with untreated controls, with mean enzymatic activity relative to wild-type mice of 7.6%, 6.3%, 1.7% and 0.31% in the heart, cortex, liver and kidney, respectively (Fig. 5d and Extended Data Fig. 10d). These data demonstrate the ability of in vivo PERT to restore enzyme function that has been abrogated by pathogenic endogenous PTCs.

To assess whether restoration in enzymatic activity was sufficient to rescue disease phenotypes, we performed histological analysis of brain, liver and spleen tissue from homozygous IduaW392X mice. We scored phenotypic severity on the basis of MPS-I related pathology, including hepatic and splenic foam cell accumulation, heart vessel-associated foam cell accumulation, cerebellar Purkinje cell vacuolization, splenic stromal vacuolization and pathogenic GAG accumulation.

MPS-I GAG storage pathology was observed across all tissues analysed from untreated IduaW392X homozygous mice, but was minimal or absent in treated counterparts. Purkinje cells of the cerebellum and thalamic neurons displayed moderate vacuolization in untreated homozygous IduaW392X mice and was resolved following PERT treatment with absent or minimal vacuoles (Fig. 5e,f and Supplementary Note). We observed a similar pattern of attenuated vacuolization in the spleen, liver and heart in treated cohorts (Fig. 5e,f). Pathogenic accumulation of foam cells observed in the liver, heart and spleen in untreated mice was absent in the treated cohort (Fig. 5e,f). Finally, the liver of untreated mice displayed mild Alcian blue staining that was minimal in the treated mice, indicating depletion of GAG accumulation (Fig. 5f). These data are consistent with previous reports that restoration of only 1% or more IDUA enzyme activity is sufficient to rescue most or all observed MPS-1 disease phenotypes5. Together, these results illustrate the in vivo applicability of PERT for PTC readthrough and rescue of disease phenotypes in a clinically relevant mouse model.

Clinical genome-editing technologies, including nucleases, base editors and prime editors, have advanced the treatment of many genetic disorders. These therapeutic approaches have predominantly been disease-specific, with most efforts requiring the design of distinct gene-correction strategies for each pathogenic mutation. Given that more than 200,000 distinct mutations collectively affect hundreds of millions of individuals, developing, manufacturing and meeting regulatory requirements for thousands of individual therapies needed to treat even a modest fraction of patients with genetic disease is a monumental challenge, creating an urgent need for allele- and disease-agnostic therapeutic approaches that can address large classes of mutations with a single therapeutic composition.

As one potential disease-agnostic strategy, we developed PERT as a prime editing-mediated approach to convert redundant endogenous tRNAs into optimized sup-tRNAs. This strategy combines the durable, one-time treatment potential of genome editing with the broad applicability of sup-tRNAs. Through high-throughput evaluation of thousands of variants spanning all 418 high-confidence tRNA genes, we identified sup-tRNAs that are capable of reading through 32% of all possible nonsense mutations with precise amino acid correction (installing the wild-type amino acid in response to the PTC), including Arg and Leu sup-tRNAs that can read through TGA stop codons and Leu, Ser and Tyr sup-tRNAs that can read through TAG stop codons. Whereas precise amino acid correction is the most conservative strategy, many nonsense mutations may still be rescued with non-wild-type amino acid substitutions, although characterization of the missense protein variant in these cases is necessary53.

Among the sup-tRNAs tested, tRNA-Leu-TAA-1-1 exhibited the highest baseline readthrough efficiency. By swapping the anticodon of the endogenous tRNA-Leu-TAA-1-1 gene to CTA and introducing prime editing-accessible mutations in the anticodon stem, we engineered sup-tRNAs variants capable of restoring more than 35% of wild-type protein activity and/or expression from a gene containing a TAG nonsense mutation, surpassing the therapeutic threshold known for many loss-of-function genetic diseases46,47,48. In mouse models, including those for Hurler syndrome, PERT treatment demonstrated substantial protein restoration and near-complete rescue of disease pathology.

During the course of this study, we did not observe any evident toxicity from PERT in any cultured cells or mice, changes in the transcriptome of cells, including the abundance of other tRNAs, readthrough of natural stop codons in human cells or in tissues from PERT-treated mice using proteome-wide mass spectrometry, or any off-target editing using two genome-wide detection methods. Since the stoichiometry of cellular tRNAs can influence global translation outcomes22,23,24, we hypothesize that conversion of a single endogenous genomic tRNA gene into a sup-tRNA may be less perturbative to global translation outcomes than previous approaches to introduce sup-tRNAs by exogenous overexpression or delivery4,5.

Not all endogenous tRNA genes could be converted into effective sup-tRNAs with a simple anticodon change. In some cases, only specific isodecoders within a family were functional sup-tRNAs (for example, Tyr-GTA but not Tyr-ATA). Some sup-tRNAs favoured TAG stop codon readthrough (for example, Tyr-GTA), whereas others supported readthrough of only TGA stop codons (for example, Arg-TCG). We were unable to identify an effective prime editing-installed sup-tRNA for TAA stop codons with low-copy screening, although future efforts could explore reporter sensitivity adjustments or additional tRNA mutations in order to achieve this goal. Although certain patterns emerge in these data—such as the identification of Ser and Leu sup-tRNA backbones, which do not rely on the anticodon loop for recognition by their aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases54,55—it remains unclear why a functional Ala sup-tRNA, which also is thought to lack synthetase recognition of the anticodon, was not identified. Our data suggest that the determinants of sup-tRNA effectiveness, despite extensive study, remain incompletely understood.

Efficiency of sup-tRNA readthrough also depends on the sequence context of the nonsense mutation. Across the sequence contexts of 14,746 pathogenic TAG stop codons in ClinVar, more than 70% showed readthrough from PERT. However, additional factors outside of the immediate sequence context are also likely to influence sup-tRNA activity, including ribosome velocity and PTC position in the mRNA. Further improvements may come from mutations beyond the anticodon stem, such as alterations in the D- or T-loops, which may enhance aminoacylation, transcription or ribosome accommodation of sup-tRNAs. Alternative methods for integrating a sup-tRNA sequence into the genome, such as twin prime editing (twinPE)34, eePASSIGE56, CASTs57,58 or methods based on homology-directed repair58, may facilitate the incorporation of more advanced combinations of mutations. Combining PERT with readthrough-promoting small molecules may further boost functional protein restoration. We also anticipate that, although our primary goal was to optimize a sup-tRNA specifically for one-time genomic installation, the best-performing variants we identified could improve readthrough efficiency when delivered through tRNA-supplementation approaches such as AAV- or LNP-mediated delivery of sup-tRNAs.

Additional studies are needed to investigate and optimize the safety, efficacy and ability of the strategy developed in this study to be delivered to relevant tissues through viral and non-viral in vivo delivery methods. Future work could explore tissue-targeted capsid engineering, receptor-specific LNP-mediated or engineered virus-like particle-mediated59,60 delivery, and regulated or transient expression systems that avoid unnecessary long-term exposure to editing agents. Nevertheless, the findings of this initial study highlight the potential of PERT as a disease-agnostic therapeutic strategy in which a single composition of matter may offer a one-time treatment that benefits many different cohorts of patients with diverse genetic diseases. For example, approximately 8,000 people with cystic fibrosis61, 252,000 people with Stargardt disease62, 31,000 people with phenylketonuria63 and 43,500 people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy64 have nonsense mutations in CFTR, ABCA4, PAH or DMD, respectively, that could in principle be treated with common PERT prime editing agents after further optimization.

Although direct DNA-level correction of pathogenic mutations remains the most straightforward approach to precision genetic medicine, the large effort currently required to develop, meet regulatory requirements and manufacture many gene editing agents needed to correct many mutations underscores the importance of complementary allele-agnostic and disease-agnostic approaches such as PERT to maximize the ability of patients to benefit from advances in gene editing. By enabling a single treatment to address a broad cross-section of nonsense mutation-related diseases, PERT represents an advance toward making therapeutic genome editing accessible to a much larger patient population. We hope that PERT and the flexibility of prime editing will stimulate additional allele-agnostic and mutation-agnostic therapeutic gene editing strategies that may provide broadly applicable treatments for diverse serious disorders.

DNA amplification was conducted by PCR using Phusion U Green Multiplex PCR Master Mix (ThermoFisher Scientific) or Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity 2× Master Mix (New England BioLabs) unless otherwise noted. DNA oligonucleotides were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies. Plasmids expressing epegRNAs were constructed by Gibson assembly using a custom acceptor plasmid. Sequences of sgRNA and epegRNA constructs used in this work are listed in Supplementary Table 1. All vectors for mammalian cell experiments were purified using Plasmid Plus Midiprep kits (Qiagen) or PureYield plasmid miniprep kits (Promega), which include endotoxin removal steps. All experiments using live animals were approved by the Broad Institute Institutional and Animal Care and Use Committees. Wild-type C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Charles River (027).

Cell lines with homozygous PTCs in TPP1, HEXA and NPC1were generated using prime editing. HEK293T (ATCC CRL-3216), Neuro-2a (ATCC CCL-131) and HeLa (CCL-2) cells were purchased from ATCC and cultured and passaged in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) plus GlutaMAX (ThermoFisher Scientific), supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Gibco, qualified). All cell types were incubated, maintained, and cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cell lines were authenticated by their respective suppliers and tested negative for mycoplasma.

HEK293T cells were seeded at 100,000 cells per well on 24-well plates (Corning). 16–24 h after seeding, cells were transfected at approximately 60% confluency with 600 ng, 200 ng and 60 ng of PEmax plasmid, epegRNA plasmid and ngRNA plasmid, respectively using Lipofectamine 3000 according to manufacturer's instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 4 d after transfection, single cell clones were isolated by limiting dilution cloning and expanded over a 2-week period. The resulting colonies were further expanded and genotyped by high-throughput sequencing of the targeted locus and those found to be homozygous for the expected edit were retained for downstream experiments.

HEK293Ts (ATCC CRL-3216) were transfected with pMD2.G (Addgene #12259) and delta8.2 (Addgene Plasmid #8455) packaging plasmids alongside the appropriate lentiviral backbone using Lipofectamine 2000. Lentiviral backbone sequences used in this work are listed in Supplementary Table 1. Medium was changed 24 h after transfection. Virus-containing supernatant was collected and filtered through a 0.45-μM filter 48 h after transfection. Virus was used immediately or stored at 4 °C for up to 1 week before cell transduction.

All oligonucleotides for high-throughput screening were ordered from Twist Biosciences as single-stranded oligonucleotide pools. Oligonucleotide pools were amplified using Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix (NEB M0494L) to create double-stranded inserts for isothermal assembly. Primers used are indicated in each specific screening section of the Methods. The minimum number of PCR cycles was used to amplify (typically between 11 and 13 cycles) and double-stranded inserts were checked for size and/or inappropriate products by TapeStation (Agilent). For each 20-μl reaction cloned into the pSEP0308, pSEP0309 or pSEP0310 lentiviral backbones with a 300-bp insert, 50 ng of the appropriate lentiviral backbone was assembled with 10 ng of the appropriate double-stranded insert using NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix (NEB E2621L). Reactions were scaled according to the number of elements in the library. For each 1,000 elements, an additional 20-μl reaction was set up. Reactions were incubated at 50 °C for 2 h and then pooled and purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen 28104) according to manufacturer's instructions. Reaction products were eluted in a minimum of 20 μl ddH2O, but otherwise were eluted in 2.5 μl per original 20-μl reaction.

Isothermal assembly reactions were electroporated into NEB 10-beta Electrocompetent Escherichia coli (NEB C3020) and plated onto LB plates aiming for at least 1,000× coverage of each library element. 14 h later, colonies were scraped and prepared using Qiagen Plasmid Plus kits (Qiagen 12945 and 12963) according to manufacturer's instructions. Pooled plasmids were transfected into HEK293Ts alongside lentiviral packaging plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000. Medium was changed 24 h after transfection. Virus-containing supernatant was collected and filtered through a 0.45-μM filter 48 h after transfection. Cells were transduced with virus aiming for a multiplicity of infection of 0.3. Cells were transduced to ensure ≥1,000× coverage of transduced cells per element of the library. 2 d after transduction, cells were passaged with 1 μg ml−1 puromycin for 3–4 days to enrich for transduced cells. For screens requiring FACS isolation of GFP-positive cells, we calculated approximate coverage by multiplying the per cent of GFP-positive cells by the number of elements in the library and aiming for 1,000× coverage of that number. For example, if 10% of cells were GFP-positive for a 500 element library, we sorted at least 50,000 cells per replicate. Cells were pelleted and flash frozen on dry ice. Genomic DNA was isolated using QIAamp DNA Micro kits (Qiagen 56304) or QIAamp Mini kits (Qiagen 51304) depending on the cell number isolated.

All genomic DNA for each replicate was input into an initial set of PCR reactions using Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix (NEB M0494L) to amplify the integrated lentiviral cassette and to add sequencing adapters, with a maximum of 5 μg genomic DNA per 50-μl reaction. Primers used are indicated in each screening section and are also listed in Supplementary Table 1. PCR reactions were purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen 28104) according to manufacturer's instructions and 2 μl of PCR product was input into a second PCR reaction to add unique sample indices and flow cell adapters to each amplicon. Final PCR reactions were bead purified with a ratio of 0.7× using SPRI beads, quality controlled using a TapeStation (Agilent) and quantified using a Qubit prior to high-throughput sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq, Illumina NextSeq, or Element Biosciences AVITI instrument. Sequencing conditions and downstream analyses are specific to each screen and are indicated in each separate screening section.

To convert each endogenous tRNA into a sup-tRNA, we identified 418 high-confidence tRNA genes and identified the two closest 20-bp spacers with an NGG protospacer-adjacent motif upstream and downstream of the anticodon. We allowed prime editing to target multiple tRNAs in the case of identical mature tRNA sequences. We systematically varied the PBS lengths from 11 bp to 14 bp, and varied the RTT homology lengths 3′ of the last edited nucleotide from 6 bp to 10 bp, where feasible. We designed three prime editing screens, each with RTTs that replaced the anticodon of each endogenous tRNA with one of three sup-tRNA anticodons (CUA, UCA or UUA). To enhance prime editing efficiency, we appended a structured RNA motif, tevopreQ1, to the 3′ end of each pegRNA, creating epegRNAs29. In total, we designed 17,579 epegRNAs to convert endogenous tRNAs to sup-tRNAs for each of the three possible sup-tRNA anticodons. Each pool also included 420 control epegRNAs targeting serine and arginine tRNAs, swapping their anticodons for those of other serine and arginine anticodons, which are not expected to give signal in a readthrough-based screen (Supplementary Table 2). We included a unique barcode sequence 3′ of the polyT terminator sequence for each epegRNA to improve our ability to assign each sequencing read to the correct element. The final oligonucleotides had the following design: a common 5′ end for isothermal assembly (5′-tatcttgtggaaaggacgaaacacc-3′), a unique epegRNA sequence followed by a polyT for Pol III termination, an adjustable length linker used to ensure that each element of the library was the same length, a unique 25 bp barcode, and a common 3′ end for isothermal assembly (5′-ctcgagtactaggatccattaggcg-3′). Oligonucleotides were amplified using oSEP0114 and oSEP0115 prior to isothermal assembly into a linearized pSEP0308 with a hU6 promoter for driving expression of the epegRNAs. Final libraries for next generation sequencing were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq instrument using oSEP0213 as a custom Read1 primer with 300 cycles. For analysis, the first 25 cycles of the read were matched exactly to the barcode for each element of the screening pool, allowing for no mismatches. Reads were normalized on the basis of sequencing depth and sorted samples were compared with the plasmid pool representation of each element. Oligonucleotides and results for this screen are listed in Supplementary Table 2.

To evaluate a wide range of tRNA promoter variants in high-throughput, we took the 418 high-confidence tRNA sequences from the human genome and swapped their anticodon to CUA, UCA or UUA to target the stop codons TAG, TGA or TAA, respectively. A unique barcode was assigned to each tRNA variant to reduce the likelihood that sequencing errors would influence assignment of library members. In addition, a pre-integrated Nextera Read1 adapter was included so that Read1 sequences on an Illumina instrument will read straight into the highly complex barcode for defining clusters. We cloned this pool using isothermal assembly into three different lentiviral backbones to evaluate the effect of different upstream elements on sup-tRNA efficacy: pSEP0308, which has a hU6 promoter, pSEP0309, which has a minU6 promoter and pSEP0310, which contains no exogenous promoter. For analysis, the first 25 cycles of the read were matched exactly to the barcode for each element of the screening pool, allowing for no mismatches. Reads were normalized on the basis of sequencing depth and sorted samples were compared with the plasmid pool representation of each element. Oligonucleotides and results for this screen are listed in Supplementary Table 3.

For the initial leader sequence screen, the 40 bp upstream of each endogenous high-confidence tRNA in the human genome was determined and placed upstream of the mature sequence for tRNA-Leu-TAA-3-1 with its anticodon changed to CUA followed by a polyT termination sequence. As controls, the same leader sequences were placed upstream of the mature sequence for tRNA-Leu-TAA-3-1 with its native anticodon. Libraries were sequenced and exact matching was used for both the leader sequence and the anticodon region of the read to assign to the correct library element. Oligonucleotides and results for this screen are recorded in Supplementary Table 4.

To next screen leader sequences across a wide range of sup-tRNAs, we generated a lentiviral library containing six leader sequences (two top-performing, two bottom-performing and two random sequences) paired with 418 human tRNAs with their anticodons switched to CUA, UCA or UAA. We also assessed the effect of each terminator sequence when placed downstream of sup-tRNAs paired with their endogenous leader sequences, with a total of 11,543 combinations of leader sequence, sup-tRNA and terminator. We included a unique 20-bp barcode sequence 3′ of the terminator sequence for each tRNA to improve our ability to assign each sequencing read to the correct element. For analysis, the first 25 cycles of the read were matched exactly to the barcode for each element of the screening pool, allowing for no mismatches. For analysis, alignment was confirmed between tRNA elements and the 20-bp barcode region and then subsequently the 20-bp barcode was used to assign each read to the appropriate library element. Reads were normalized on the basis of sequencing depth and sorted samples were compared with the plasmid pool representation of each element. Oligonucleotides and results for this screen are recorded in Supplementary Table 5.

To design variants for saturation mutagenesis screening, every sequence containing a SNV, paired substitution at all hairpin positions, and 1-bp deletion was generated computationally. Then, 25 bp ends compatible with isothermal assembly were added to either side (see Supplementary Table 1) and a unique barcode was assigned to each tRNA variant to reduce the likelihood that sequencing errors would influence assignment of library members. In addition, a pre-integrated Nextera Read1 adapter was included so that Read1 sequences on an Illumina instrument will read straight into the highly complex barcode for defining clusters. Variants were ordered as a Twist oligonucleotide pool for each individual tRNA for tRNA-Leu-TAA-4-1, tRNA-Arg-CCT-4-1, mouse tRNA-Leu-TAA-2-1 and tRNA-Tyr-GTA-2-1 (sequences in Supplementary Table 6). A pooled library of all possible variants for tRNA-Leu-TAA-1-1, tRNA-Leu-TAA-2-1, tRNA-Leu-TAA-3-1, and tRNA-Leu-TAA-4-1 was ordered as a separate Leu-TAA focused library (sequences in Supplementary Table 7).

For the tRNA-Arg-CCT-4-1, mouse tRNA-Leu-TAA-2-1, and tRNA-Tyr-GTA-2-1 screens, Twist oligonucleotides contained a leader sequence element for each tRNA and they were cloned by isothermal assembly into the pSEP0310 lentiviral backbone with no exogenous Pol III promoter. For the tRNA-Leu-TAA-4-1 and Leu-TAA focused library, Twist oligonucleotides did not contain a leader sequence element for each tRNA and they were cloned by isothermal assembly into the pSEP0308 lentiviral backbone with an exogenous hU6 promoter driving expression of the tRNAs. Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina instrument with 26 cycles for Read1 covering the barcode region and 86 cycles for Read2 covering the tRNA region. For analysis, alignment was confirmed between tRNA elements and the 25-bp barcode region and then subsequently the 25-bp barcode was used to assign each read to the appropriate library element.

To optimize epegRNA architectures, we designed a lentiviral epegRNA library of 17,280 epegRNAs to test out five spacer variants, PBS lengths from 8 to 16 nt, RTT lengths from 21 to 36 nt, and combinations of each of the 19 mutation variants of interest alongside 720 control epegRNAs with RTTs that do not encode an anticodon edit. On the same oligonucleotide, we encoded an adjacent tRNA-Leu-TAA-1-1 synthetic target site directly adjacent to the lentiviral epegRNA to read out both the epegRNA and the outcome of editing in the same sequencing read. We transfected cells transduced with this library with a panel of prime editor proteins that included PEmax and several engineered PE6 variants40 listed in Supplementary Data Tables 9 and 10. We performed experiments in both MMR-deficient (HEK293T) cells and MMR-proficient (HeLa) cells and included conditions in each case in which MMR was transiently inhibited by co-transfection of a dominant-negative MMR protein (MLH1dn)38. For experiments in HeLa cells, we collected genomic DNA 3 d after transfection. For experiments in HEK293T cells, we collected genomic DNA at 3 d and 9 d after transfection. We then performed high-throughput sequencing of the lentivirally integrated cassette. For analysis, sequencing reads were initially demultiplexed into individual fastq files by first aligning each read to a corresponding member of the epegRNA library using bowtie2 (ref. 65). Next, each individual fastq file was then trimmed to only include the full-length synthetic target site. Editing outcomes for each epegRNA sequence were quantified using CRISPResso2. Oligonucleotides and results for this screen are recorded in Supplementary Data Tables 9 and 10.

HEK293T cells were transfected with our optimized epegRNA sequence and ngRNA alongside PE6c or with an unrelated epegRNA and ngRNA pair targeting the HEK3 locus alongside PE6c (see Supplementary Table 1). RNA was extracted 6 d after transfection using the Qiagen RNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer's instructions. RNA-seq libraries were generated using the SMART-Seq mRNA LP kit (Takara Bio) according to manufacturer's instructions and sequenced 2× 75-bp on an Element Biosciences AVITI instrument. Fastq reads were trimmed of adapter sequences using Trim Galore, aligned to the human genome using STAR, and differential expression analysis was performed using DESeq2 and custom R scripts.

Total RNA, including small RNAs, was isolated from prime edited cells using miRNeasy kits (Qiagen) according to manufacturer's protocols. RNA was reversed transcribed with SuperScript IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using a primer specific to each tRNA gene family queried66 (Supplementary Table 1). Next, quantitative PCR was performed using Power SYBR Green PCR master mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and primers specific to each tRNA gene family queried (Supplementary Table 1). For tRNA-Leu-TAA-1-1, we performed targeted tRNA sequencing. Specifically, we measured the relative abundance of the desired tRNA edit versus unedited in a polyclonal edited population in both genomic DNA and total RNA. For targeted tRNA sequencing, we performed reverse transcription using a primer specific to tRNA-Leu-TAA-1-1 and the Induro RT enzyme that is tolerant to RNA modifications39.

To generate a diverse PTC sequence context reporter library, 14,746 naturally occurring premature TAG stop codons in protein-coding genes were identified in ClinVar that were annotated as pathogenic, likely pathogenic, or of uncertain significance. Each TAG stop codon was flanked on either side by the 18 nucleotides present in the native mRNA sequence. Positive controls were generated that contained the same sequence context but a TTG Leucine codon instead of a TAG premature stop codon. For negative controls, 2,800 ‘redundant stop' control library members were generated, which were a subset of the ClinVar variants and their TTG controls but with the codon following the TAG stop codon or TTG codon changed to a TAA stop codon followed by a +1 frameshift to prevent readthrough.

The pSEP0211 lentiviral backbone was first linearized using oSEP0163 and oSEP0164 and the oligonucleotide pool was amplified using oSEP0165 and oSEP0166 (Supplementary Table 1). These sequences were cloned into the pSEP0211 lentiviral backbone between mCherry and GFP via Gibson assembly. Two days following transduction, we extracted both mRNA and genomic DNA from the transduced cell population, generated cDNA by reverse transcription, and sequenced the integrated reporter construct from both the cDNA and genomic DNA samples. For analysis, we calculated an ‘RNA score' metric by quantifying the frequency of each element in the cDNA and dividing that value by the frequency of that element in the genomic DNA. To control for the impact each unique sequence context might have on transcript expression level independent of readthrough activity, we defined a ‘readthrough score' for each ClinVar PTC by dividing the RNA score of each variant by the RNA score of its corresponding no-premature-stop equivalent. Oligonucleotides and results for this screen are recorded in Supplementary Table 15.

To identify candidate off-target prime editing sites, we used Cas-OFFinder67 to identify all human genomic sequences with up to six mismatches, or up to four mismatches combined with up to two bulges relative to our optimized epegRNA spacer sequence. To account for target-site binding and potential annealing of the full-length RTT product, we extracted the local sequence surrounding these sites to include 3 bp upstream of the putative target site and 34 bp downstream. We included 100 uniquely barcoded positive-control sequences corresponding to the endogenous tRNA-Leu-TAA-1-1 site and 694 negative-control sequences that shared no homology with the epegRNA spacer sequence. These sequences were cloned into the pSEP0310 lentiviral backbone and transduced into HEK293T cells after lentiviral production. These cells were then transfected with an epegRNA expression plasmid alone as a negative control, or with a PE6c prime editor expression plasmid alongside the epegRNA expression plasmid. 3 d after transfection, genomic DNA was isolated and the lentiviral integrated target site was amplified for high-throughput sequencing. The amplified target-site was sequenced using 2× 115 paired-end high-throughput sequencing. For analysis, high-throughput sequencing reads were initially demultiplexed into individual fastq files by first aligning each read to a corresponding member of the target-site library using bowtie2 (ref. 65). Next, each individual fastq file was then trimmed to only include the full-length putative off-target site. Putative off-target editing events were characterized as previously described34. In brief, the sequence encoded by the RTT was compared base-by-base to the nucleotide sequence 3′ of the cas9 nick site of each potential off-target site with an ‘off-target marker' sequence being identified as the minimal deviating sequence between the two. The presence of this off-target marker sequence was quantified using output from CRISPResso2 and was used as a proxy for off-target prime editing. Oligonucleotides and results for this screen are recorded in Supplementary Table 11.

For initial off-target analysis, we used Cas-OFFinder to identify all human genomic sequences with up to 4 mismatches relative to our optimized epegRNA spacer sequence. A pooled sequencing primer was generated for nominated human off-target sites using the rhAmpSeq design tool (IDT). Genomic DNA was extracted from editor-treated HEK293T cells and amplified with rhAmpSeq pooled sequencing primers according to the manufacturer's protocol. The amplified libraries were sequenced with 300-bp single-end reads with an Illumina MiSeq. Sequences for rhAmpSeq amplicons were extracted using the R Bioconductor BSGenome package (v.1.4.3) using the GRCh37/hg19 (human) reference genomes. CRISPResso2 was used to align the rhAmpSeq reads to the amplicon reference sequences and quantify the number of reads with each possible edit.

Cells were trypsinized, resuspended in media containing 10% FBS, and the solution was filtered through a 45-μm cell strainer prior to flow cytometry or FACS isolation. Flow cytometry analysis was performed using the CytoFLEX LX Flow Cytometer (Beckman Coulter, C06779) at the Broad Institute Flow Cytometry Core, with CytExpert Acquisition and Analysis Software (v.2.4). FACS was performed on the SONY MA900 Cell Sorter (Sony Biotechnology) and cells were sorted into medium prior to being spun down.

Plasmid vectors for mammalian expression of epegRNAs or ngRNAs were cloned via isothermal assembly as previously described67. In brief, a human U6 promoter vector was linearized via polymerase chain reaction and incubated with IDT eBlocks encoding the full-length epegRNA or ngRNA sequence flanked by sequences necessary for isothermal assembly using NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix (New England BioLabs). A list of epegRNA and ngRNA sequences used in this study are provided in Supplementary Table 1.

AAV vector genomes were cloned via isothermal assembly as previously described50. In brief, the v3em vector genome construct (Addgene, #198735) was linearized by restriction digest and new epegRNA and ngRNA sequences, encoded across two IDT eBlocks, were inserted via isothermal assembly using NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix (New England BioLabs). The PE6d and PE6e v3em vectors were assembled via isothermal assembly using NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix (New England BioLabs). The sequences of interest were PCR amplified out of existing vectors (Addgene, #207854 and 207855) and assembled into the corresponding v3em vector (Addgene, #198735 and #193734).

For all experiments performed in HEK293T or HeLa readthrough reporter polyclonal cell lines and experiments performed in Neuro-2a cells, cells were seeded at 12,000 cells per well into 96-well plates (Corning) and transfected the following day with Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). A total of 200 ng, 66 ng and 22 ng of prime editor plasmid, epegRNA plasmid and ngRNA plasmid (where indicated), respectively, were transfected per well. 3 d after transfection, cells were lysed and genomic DNA was collected by incubation in a lysis buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.05% SDS and 800 units per μl of proteinase K (New England BioLabs) at 37 °C for 1 h, followed by enzyme inactivation at 80 °C for 30 min.

For rescue experiments performed in the HEK293T disease models, cells were initially seeded at 200,000 cells per well in 12-well plates (Corning). The following day, cells were transfected with 700 ng of PE6c prime editor plasmid, 200 ng of epegRNA plasmid and 75 ng of ngRNA plasmid using Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 3 d after transfection, genomic DNA was extracted as described above.

For assays using human cells, cells were collected by trypsinization, pelleted, washed in 1× phosphate-buffered saline and repelleted. For the tripeptidyl peptidase (TPP1) assay, pelleted cells were lysed at 4 °C for 30 min in a buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) and 10% SDS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in 1× phosphate-buffered saline. For the hexosaminidase (HEXA) assay, pelleted cells were lysed in a RIPA homogenizing buffer supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) at 4 °C for 30 min. In both cases, lysates were then centrifuged at 20,000g for 20 min at 4 °C. Supernatant was collected and total protein concentration was quantified using the Pierce BCA protein assay kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For both HEXA and TPP1 assays, the sensitivity and accuracy of the assay was determined by a standard curve derived from measurements of known quantities of wild-type protein lysate (Supplementary Fig. 10b,c).

For the TPP1 assay, 10 μg of protein lysate was incubated at 37 °C overnight in a 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer at pH 4 containing the Ala-Ala-Phe-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin substrate (Sigma, A3401) at a final concentration of 250 μM in a reaction volume of 40 μl. Endpoint fluorescence was then measured with a Tecan Spark Multimode Microplate Reader with an excitation wavelength of 360 nm (20 nm bandwidth) and emission of wavelength of 460 nm (20 nm bandwidth). Enzymatic activity relative to wild-type was calculated by dividing the mean fluorescence values from each treatment condition by the mean fluorescence values of mock-treated wild-type HEK293T cells.

For the HEXA assay, 5 μg of protein lysate was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in a 0.1 M citrate phosphate buffer at pH 4.5 containing either 4-methylumbelliferone-f-N-acetylglucosamine (MUG, Sigma, 69585) or 4-methylumbelliferone-O-N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfate (MUGS, Sigma, 454428) substrate at a concentration of 3.2 mM. Each reaction was carried out in a total volume of 50 μl and stopped by the addition of 200 μl of a 100 mM solution of 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol. Endpoint fluorescence measurements were made with a Tecan Spark Multimode Microplate Reader with an excitation wavelength of 360 nm (20 nm bandwidth) and emission of wavelength of 450 nm (20 nm bandwidth). HEXA activity was normalized to HEXB activity by dividing the mean fluorescence values from the MUGS (HEXA) reaction by the corresponding mean fluorescence values from the MUG (HEXB) reaction. Enzymatic activity relative to wild-type was calculated by dividing the derived mean HEXA activity values for each treatment condition by that of the mean HEXA activity values from mock-treated wild-type HEK293T cells.

For measurements of α-L-iduronidase in mouse tissue, protein was extracted by first homogenizing the tissue using the TissueLyser II (QIAGEN) in T-PER tissue protein extraction reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 78510) containing cOmplete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche). Lysates were then centrifuged at 20,000g for 20 min at 4 °C and supernatant was collected and total protein concentration was quantified using the Pierce BCA protein assay kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Up to 40 μg of whole protein lysate was incubated overnight in a 130 mM sodium formate buffer containing 0.42 mg ml−1 of d-saccharic acid 1,4-lactone monohydrate (Sigma-Aldrich, S0375) and 4MU-iduronic acid (0.12 mM; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-220961) at pH 3.5. Endpoint fluorescence measurements were made with a Tecan Spark Multimode Microplate Reader with an excitation wavelength of 365 nm (20 nm bandwidth) and emission of wavelength of 450 nm (20 nm bandwidth).

Cells were collected by trypsinization, pelleted, washed in 1× phosphate-buffered saline then lysed in a RIPA homogenizing buffer supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) at 4 °C for 30 min. Lysates were then centrifuged at 20,000g for 20 min at 4 °C. Supernatant was collected and total protein concentration was quantified using the Pierce BCA protein assay kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Up to 10 μg of whole protein lysate was separated by SDS–PAGE using a 4–12% Bolt Bis-Tris Plus Mini Protein Gel (Invitrogen). Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using the iBlot 2 Dry Blotting system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) then incubated in a 5% milk solution in 1 × Tris-Buffered Saline, 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST). The blocked membrane was incubated at 4 °C overnight in NPC1 (Abcam, ab134113, 1:2,500 dilution) or GAPDH (Santa Cruz, sc-47724, 1:5,000 dilution) primary antibody. The following day, the membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Abcam, ab6721; 1:10,000 dilution) for NPC1 and anti-mouse IgG (Abcam, ab205719; 1:10,000 dilution) for GAPDH for 1 h at room temperature. The secondary antibody was removed and the membrane was washed and signal was collected using the SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's protocol.

Protein was isolated as described for Western blotting. To prepare samples for mass spectrometry, samples were passed over S-trap micro spin columns (Profiti) according to manufacturer's protocols with the following modifications: 10 mM DTT (final concentration) was used instead of TCEP. After adding DTT, tubes were placed on a heating block for 10 min at 95 °C. Disulfides were alkylated with 20 mM iodoacetamide (final concentration) instead of methyl methanethiosulfonate, and after adding the iodoacetamide the samples were incubated at 25 °C for 30 min in the dark. After digestion with 5 µg trypsin (Thermo Fisher 90057), samples were desalted using Pierce Peptide Desalting Spin Columns (Thermo Fisher 89852) following the manufacturer's protocol. The desalted tryptic peptides were resuspended in 100 µl of 100 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate buffer (TEAB), vortexed, and briefly centrifuged. For labelling with tandem mass tags (TMTs), lyophilized TMTpro Label reagents (Thermo Fisher A44520) were used according to manufacturer's protocols. At the time of labelling, aliquots were equilibrated at room temperature and 20 µl of anhydrous acetonitrile was added to each tube. The TMT reagents were vortexed, briefly centrifuged, and allowed to dissolve for 5 min at 25 °C. TMT reagents were added to each 100-µl sample, vortexed, and briefly centrifuged. The samples were incubated for 1 h at 25 °C. After 1 h, 5 µl of 5% hydroxylamine was added to each sample and incubated for 15 min to quench the reaction. Equal amounts of each labelled sample were then combined together and speed-vacuumed to dryness.

The TMT-labelled tryptic peptides were separated by reverse phase HPLC (Thermo Ultimate 3000) using a Thermo PepMap RSLC C18 column (2 µm tip, 75 µm x 50 cm ES903) over a gradient before nano-electrospray using a Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer (Thermo). Solvent A was 0.1% formic acid in water and solvent B was 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. The mass spectrometer was operated in a data-dependent mode. The parameters for the full scan MS were: resolution of 60,000 across 450–1,600 m/z and maximum IT 50 ms. The full mass spectrometry scan was followed by MS/MS for as many precursor ions in a three-second cycle with a NCE of 32, dynamic exclusion of 30 s and resolution of 45,000.

Raw mass spectral data files (.raw) were searched using Sequest HT in Proteome Discoverer (Thermo). Sequest search parameters were: 10 ppm mass tolerance for precursor ions; 0.02 Da for fragment ion mass tolerance; 2 missed cleavages of trypsin. Fixed modifications were carbamidomethylation of cysteine and TMTpro modification on lysines and peptide N termini. Variable modifications were methionine oxidation, methionine loss at the N terminus of the protein, acetylation of the N terminus of the protein, and methionine loss plus acetylation of the protein N terminus.

AAV production was performed using HEK293T clone 17 cells (ATCC, CRL-11268) maintained in DMEM plus GlutaMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 10% heat-inactivated FBS without antibiotic in 150 mm2 dishes (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The day before transfection cells were plated at a density of 18 million cells per 150 mm2 plate. The following day, 5.7 μg of AAV genome plasmid, 11.4 μg of pHelper (Clontech) and 22.8 μg of rep-cap plasmid per plate were delivered via polyethyleneimine transfection (PEI MAX, Polysciences). Three days after transfection, cells were collected by cell scraping and pelleted at 3,000g for 10 min. Medium was decanted into a solution of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) 8000 (Sigma-Aldrich) and NaCl at a final concentration of 8% PEG and 500 mM NaC and incubated on ice for 2 h. The cell pellet was resuspended in 500 µl per plate of a hypertonic buffer containing 40 mM Tris base, 500 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2 and 100 U ml−1 salt active nuclease (ArcticZymes) and incubated for one hour at 37 °C. The medium-containing solution was then pelleted by centrifugation at 3,000g for 30 min and the resulting pellet was resuspended in 500 µl per plate of a hypertonic lysis buffer and combined with the cell lysate. This lysate was then added to Beckman Coulter Quick-Seal tubes via 16-gauge, 5-inch needles (Air-Tite N165) in a discontinuous gradient of iodixanol in sequentially floating layers as follows: 9 ml of 15% iodixanol in 500 mM NaCl and 1× phosphate-buffered saline-MK (1× phosphate-buffered saline plus 1 mM MgCl2 and 2.5 mM KCl), 6 ml of 25% iodixanol in 1× phosphate-buffered saline-MK and 5 ml each of 40% and 60% iodixanol in 1× phosphate-buffered saline-MK with phenol red at a concentration of 1 μg ml−1 in the 15%, 25% and 60% layers to aid layer visualization This gradient was then ultracentrifuged using a fixed-angle Ti 70 rotor in an Optima XPN-100 Ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter) at 68,000 rpm for one hour at 18 °C. Next, 3 ml of virus-containing solution was extracted from the 40–60% iodixanol interface via an 18-gauge needle. Buffer was exchanged for cold phosphate-buffered saline with 0.001% F-68 using a PES 100 kD MWCO column (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and concentrated. The resulting AAV-containing solution was sterile filtered using a 0.22-μm filter and quantified by quantitative PCR (qPCR) (AAVpro Titration Kit version 2, Clontech). Purified virus was stored at 4 °C until use.

All experiments involving live animals were approved by the Broad Institute Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (D16-00903; 0048-04-15-2). Mouse housing facilities were maintained at 20–22 °C with 30–50% humidity, on a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle with ad libitum access to standard rodent diet and water. For experiments involving IduaW392X mice, we used Strain from Jackson Laboratory.

Syringes for microinjection were prepared by pulling PCR Micropipettes (Drummond Scientific Company, 5-000-1001-X10) with the Sutter P1000 micropipette puller for a tip diameter size of 100 μm. The injection solution was prepared by mixing 5 × 1010 vg of each half of prime editor encoding AAV and 1 × 1010 vg of reporter AAV in 0.9% NaCl solution (Covetrus, 061758) in total volume of 4 μl, along with 0.1 μl of Fast Green. A total of 4 μl of injection solution was front-loaded to the micropipette syringe for injection. Neonatal mice were anaesthetized on ice. A total of 2 μl of injection solution was injected into each ventricle with successful injection being verified by the spread of Fast Green dye by transillumination of the head. Litters were randomized for injection with a given AAV composition. Both sexes were included for each experimental condition for in vivo experiments. Both sexes were assigned to each experimental group as evenly as possible. No statistics were performed to pre-determine sample size for each group.

In experiments demonstrating readthrough of an exogenous reporter co-administered via AAV, we evaluated both TAG and TGA stop codon readthrough. To achieve TGA stop codon readthrough, we used the epegRNA architecture optimized for the introduction of the CUA anticodon but modified the 3′ extension to introduce a UCA anticodon. The reporter construct contained an eGFP expression cassette with either a TAG or TGA PTC at codon 81 or the wild-type glutamine codon. In experiments evaluating the long-term tolerability of PERT, we delivered editing reagents in the v3em dual-AAV architecture introducing either an CUA anticodon into the mouse tRNA-Leu-TAA-2-1 gene, or a control +5 G-to-T edit in the Dnmt1 locus. At three weeks, the cortices and livers from mice were processed for whole proteome mass spectrometry to evaluate readthrough past natural stop codons.

Mice used in this study were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation, and unperfused tissues were immediately dissected. For protein and DNA analysis, dissected tissues were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Protein extraction was performed as described above. Genomic DNA and RNA was extracted using the QIAGEN AllPrep DNA/RNA kit according to the manufacturer's protocol.

For histology and immunohistochemistry, dissected tissues were placed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and then soaked in 70% ethanol prior to paraffin embedding. Following routine processing and paraffin embedding, tissue sections were stained with either haematoxylin and eosin, Alcian blue, or prepared for immunohistochemistry. For immunohistochemistry, 4-μm-thick sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated, followed by antigen retrieval using a sodium citrate buffer. After quenching endogenous peroxidase and application of a protein block (Dako), sections were incubated with either an anti-GFP antibody (Abcam, ab183734) or an anti-iduronidase (R&D systems, AF4119) antibody. Staining was detected using a species-specific detection kit, diaminobenzidine was used as the chromogen, and Mayer's Haematoxylin (Dako) was used as the counterstain. Primary antibodies were substituted with an appropriate negative-control IgG for negative-control slides. For Alcian blue staining, 4-μm formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated. Sections were stained with the Alcian Blue–1%, pH 2.5 kit (Newcomer, 9102A). Tissue histopathology was performed at the University of Minnesota Comparative Pathology Shared Resource and pathology scoring was performed by a board-certified veterinary pathologist blinded to the treatment conditions.

All screens were performed in independent biological duplicates. Sample sizes for all other experiments and analyses are defined in the corresponding figure legends. Where performed, select comparisons are indicated within the figure, and P values can be found in corresponding Supplementary Tables.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

The scientific community believe a small species of human known as homo floresiensis once lived on the island of Flores, Indonesia, around 50,000 years ago. But one professor thinks the apelike humanoids could still live there, evolution be damned.

Think of this as the hunt for Bigfoot, only with a much smaller target.

Gregory Forth has studied the homo floresiensis for roughly four decades—first when at the University of Oxford and then at the University of Alberta. He wrote a book in 2022, Between Ape and Human: An Anthropologist on the Trail of a Hidden Hominoid, and The Debrief ran an interview with Forth on the quest. 

Forth still believes in the modern interpretation of what the locals call the lai ho'a.

“What really interested me in the lai ho'a is that it was small, like the figures in Nage country,” Forth told The Debrief, “but it was reckoned still to be alive. And indeed, there were a few people around, it seemed, who claimed to have seen one or more.”

These creatures have a human-like upright gait, come hairier than humans but not as hairy as an ape, and have a distinct ape-like face, according to the Lio people's accounts to Forth. 

The professor's hopes of a living homo floresiensis were emboldened at the finding of fossils roughly 20 years ago. 

“When the reports started coming out, I was quite amazed,” he told The Debrief, “because what people were describing—what paleoanthropologists were describing, and indeed reconstructing—sounded very much like what the Lio people had been describing to me the previous summer.”

Forth's book purports that these ape-man creatures lived at least into modern times, and he believes credible sightings mean there's a chance a small population still exists. The search for a modern-day lai ho'a presses on.

Every moment, the bone marrow generates millions of fresh blood and immune cells. This nonstop renewal depends on a carefully balanced relationship between hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), supportive stromal cells, and a network of immune signals.

Over the years, this balance becomes vulnerable. Aging, chronic inflammation, or somatic mutations can disrupt communication among these cell groups, reducing normal stem-cell renewal and allowing mutated HSCs to expand unnoticed. This process leads to clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), which appears in about 10 to 20% of adults over 60 and nearly 30% of those over 80.

Although people with CHIP typically have no symptoms, the condition increases the risk of blood cancers by tenfold and doubles the likelihood of cardiovascular disease and early death. Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), a related disorder involving clonal HSCs, causes inefficient blood-cell production and gradual failure of the bone marrow. It affects up to 20 in every 100,000 adults over 70, and around 30% of cases advance to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), an aggressive and often fatal cancer.

Despite the seriousness of these disorders, the contribution of the bone marrow microenvironment to their development has remained unclear.

Mapping Hidden Changes in the Bone Marrow Microenvironment

To better understand how mutated HSC clones gain dominance, an international research team co-led by Judith Zaugg from EMBL and University of Basel and Borhane Guezguez from UMC Mainz carried out an extensive molecular and spatial analysis of human bone marrow. The samples came from the BoHemE cohort study in collaboration with Uwe Platzbecker at the National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT) Dresden.

Using single-cell RNA sequencing, biopsy imaging, proteomics, and co-culture models, the researchers created a detailed map of the bone marrow microenvironment in healthy donors (including those with CHIP) and in patients with MDS. Their analysis revealed an unexpected cellular shift that begins long before clinical signs appear. The team found that a population of inflammatory stromal cells gradually replaces the usual mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) that support stem-cell function.

"I was surprised to observe such pronounced remodeling of the bone marrow microenvironment already in individuals with CHIP, although the underlying cause-and-effect relationships remain unclear," said Zaugg, co-senior author, EMBL Group Leader, and Professor at Basel University.

Unlike healthy stromal cells, these inflammatory MSCs (iMSC) produce large amounts of interferon-induced cytokines and chemokines. These molecules attract and activate interferon-responsive T cells, which then intensify the inflammatory activity. This creates a feed-forward loop that maintains chronic inflammation, disrupts normal blood formation, and contributes to vascular changes in the marrow.

Identifying What Drives Bone Marrow Inflammation

Interestingly, the researchers did not find signs that mutated hematopoietic cells in MDS directly trigger this inflammatory response. They were able to separate mutated from non-mutated cells using SpliceUp, a computational method developed by co-lead author and EMBL alumnus Maksim Kholmatov in collaboration with Pedro Moura and Eva Hellström-Lindberg from Karolinska Institute. SpliceUp identifies mutated cells in single-cell datasets by detecting abnormal RNA-splicing patterns. In MDS, the inflammatory network within the microenvironment becomes dominant and replaces much of the marrow's normal regenerative structure.

"Another striking observation was that MDS stem cells couldn't trigger stromal cells to produce CXCL12, an important signal that triggers blood cells to settle in the bone marrow. This failure may help explain why the bone marrow stops working properly," said Karin Prummel, co-lead author and EMBL postdoc.

"It was quite surprising to see the lack of a direct inflammatory effect that we could attribute to the mutant cells," said Maksim Kholmatov, co-lead author and EMBL alumnus. "However, when viewed in the context of changes in the T cell and stromal compartments, it underlines the importance of the bone marrow microenvironment in shaping disease progression."

Inflammation as an Early Driver of Blood Disease

These findings indicate that inflammation plays a central role in the earliest phases of disease and highlight the bone marrow microenvironment (also called the bone marrow niche) as a key therapeutic focus. By directing attention to the ecosystem that supports mutated stem cells rather than the mutated cells alone, the research points to new opportunities for early treatment and prevention.

Anti-inflammatory drugs or therapies that adjust interferon signaling may help preserve marrow function in older adults with CHIP. Combining targeted treatments with therapies that act on the microenvironment could slow or prevent the transition from CHIP to MDS or AML. The specific molecular features of iMSCs and interferon-responsive T cells may also serve as early biomarkers for people at elevated risk.

"Our findings reveal that the bone marrow microenvironment actively shapes the earliest stages of malignant evolution," said Guezguez, Principal Investigator in the Department of Hematology at UMC Mainz and co-senior author. "As advances in molecular profiling allow us to detect pre-leukemic states years before clinical onset, understanding how stromal and immune cells interact provides a foundation for preventive therapies that intercept disease progression before leukemia develops."

Inflammaging and the Wider Impact on Age-Related Disease

Beyond blood disorders, the results contribute to a broader understanding of 'inflammaging', the low-level, chronic inflammation that supports many age-related conditions, including cancer and cardiovascular and metabolic disease. The bone marrow, once considered only a site of blood production, now appears to be both affected by and responsible for systemic inflammatory aging. By showing how interactions between immune and stromal cells drive these changes, the study offers a model for exploring inflammatory remodeling in other myeloid malignancies and advanced leukemia.

"It will be crucial to study these processes over time; our current findings are based on cross-sectional data," Zaugg said. "This has important implications for therapies that replace malignant cells but leave the bone marrow niche intact, such as blood stem cell transplantation. We are now investigating to what extent the niche retains a 'memory' of disease, which could shape how it responds to new, healthy stem cells."

The work appears alongside a complementary study examining the MDS bone marrow microenvironment, also published in Nature Communications and led by Marc Raaijmakers from Erasmus MC Cancer Institute in Rotterdam. Together, the two studies offer a more complete view of inflammatory remodeling during the early phases of bone marrow disease.

The research involved collaborators from UMC Mainz, University of Basel, University Hospital Dresden, Karolinska Institute Sweden, The Jackson Laboratory USA, Sorbonne University, France, and DKTK partner institutions, including DKFZ and NCT Dresden. Funding came from the DKTK-CHOICE programme, the ERC grant EpiNicheAML to Judith Zaugg, the MCSA-funded ITN ENHPATHY, EMBO, Swiss National Foundation, and the José Carreras Leukämie-Stiftung.

Is Melatonin Safe? Experts Explain the Potential Risks—And the Benefits

Melatonin supplements have become a ubiquitous sleep aid, but research shows that benefits are modest, and the heart health effects of long-term use are unknown

As many as 70 million people in the U.S. have problems with sleep, and many are increasingly turning to melatonin supplements to help them fall asleep. People generally perceive these over-the-counter gummies, liquids and tablets as harmless. But recent research has raised new questions about whether the popular sleep aid is as benign as people assume, especially the longer it's used.

Melatonin is a hormone that humans naturally produce, as do all other mammals, including bears, and birds. It regulates the body's circadian rhythm, the 24-hour biological “clock” that influences when we are sleepy or awake and alert. The body's melatonin levels fluctuate in response to light—the brain's control center for sleep suppresses levels during the day and boosts levels at night. As the hormone circulates in the bloodstream, it tones down the signals that keep us awake, but it doesn't cause sleep, says Jennifer Martin, a psychologist at the Florida International University. Instead of acting like a sedative, melatonin sends the body biological signals that it's nighttime.

Melatonin supplements are generally considered safe, but some people do report headaches, dizziness or nausea after exposure. Taking too much at one time can disrupt sleep rather than improve it. Too much of the drug may also trigger something akin to a melatonin hangover the next day: lingering amounts in the blood can cause grogginess and tiredness.

Supplements are sold with doses that are “much, much higher than anybody is naturally producing,” says Jamie Zeitzer, a sleep specialist at Stanford University. The hormone is commonly sold in five-milligram concentrations, though some “extra strength” products say they contain up to 40 milligrams.

“More isn't better,” Martin says. “For a lot of people, a small dose is the most beneficial.”

Getting the right amount can be tricky. While the melatonin used in supplements is chemically identical to that produced in the body, the actual amount of the hormone in these products may not match what's on their label. Some over-the-counter products contained anywhere from 80 percent less to about 470 percent more melatonin than advertised, a 2017 study found. Melatonin is sold as a supplement, which means such products reach the market without the Food and Drug Administration first evaluating their safety or production standards. Shalini Paruthi, a sleep medicine physician at John J. Cochran Veterans Hospital in St. Louis and spokesperson for the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, says to look for U.S. Pharmacopeia–certified products, which are tested for the quantity of their listed ingredients.

At a conference in early November, researchers at SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University and their colleagues presented an analysis of U.K. medical records that raised concerns about long-term melatonin use. Almost 5 percent of 65,414 adults with insomnia who took melatonin for at least a year experienced heart failure (whereas almost 3 percent of those who did not take the sleep aid did so). People who took melatonin for at least a year were also more than three times as likely to be hospitalized for heart failure and nearly twice as likely to die from any cause compared with those who had no medical record of taking melatonin.

But some experts believe the findings, which have not yet been published or peer-reviewed, might say more about the consequences of poor sleep rather than melatonin use. “I don't see a very good reason for melatonin to be directly involved in [heart failure],” Zeitzer says. Bad sleep is more likely putting extra pressure on the cardiovascular system, he says. Chronic insomnia is already known to be related to a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, metabolic dysfunction and issues with memory, learning and mental health. A more likely explanation for the new study's trends is that people with poor sleep are relying on melatonin, which might not be helping them, Martin says.

Other long-term studies haven't found evidence that melatonin harms the heart. But there isn't much substantial, long-term safety data for melatonin.

Parents are increasingly giving their children melatonin to help with sleep. Evidence suggests it can make a real difference for some children with neurodivergent conditions. Many autistic kids, for example, have a harder time falling—and staying—asleep. That may be because they produce melatonin differently, releasing it later in the evening or in lower amounts than usual, Paruthi says. In such cases, “we would definitely recommend a low-dose melatonin to see if that helps,” she says. “And for a lot of these kids, it really does.”

The American Academy of Neurologists says clinicians should prescribe a low dose of a pharmaceutical-grade melatonin—which have a more precise dose—to autistic children if behavioral strategies haven't helped their sleep.

The hype around melatonin is a bit misleading. In placebo-controlled trials, people who take melatonin fell asleep just seven minutes faster on average and slept about eight minutes longer than those who took a placebo. But improvements are larger when participants knew they were getting melatonin. The placebo effect might explain this finding, Martin says. “When you believe something will work, you tend to be a little more relaxed and fall asleep more quickly,” she adds.

Timing seems to matter, too. In one analysis, taking melatonin about three hours before bedtime and in four-milligram doses led to the greatest improvements. Clinicians typically recommend two-milligram supplements, however. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommends melatonin for some sleep issues related to time adjustments such as jet lag and shift work but not for insomnia.

If melatonin works for you, keep using it, Zeitzer says. Evidence isn't strong enough yet to show long-term use improves or worsens health, Martin says. She suggests people should work with a specialist if their sleep problems persist. “There are effective treatments for sleep disorders,” she says. “People don't have to suffer.”

These Birds Learned to Tweet Like R2-D2. Listen to the Uncanny Results

The lovable Star Wars droid is helping to shed light on why some bird species are better at mimicking sounds than others

Join Our Community of Science Lovers!

A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, R2-D2 beeped and booped—and now birds that copy the Star Wars character are giving scientists fresh insight into how different species imitate complex sounds. A study, published recently in Scientific Reports, analyzed the sounds of nine species of parrots, including Budgies, as well as European Starlings to see how accurately each bird mimicked R2-D2's robotic whirring.

Researchers did acoustic analyses on samples of birds imitating the plucky droid that were already available online to compare how statistically similar each bird's noises were to a model of R2-D2's sounds. The starlings, a type of songbird, emerged as star vocalists: their ability to produce “multiphonic” noises—in their case, two different notes or tones expressed simultaneously—allowed them to replicate R2-D2's complex chirps more accurately. Parrots and budgies, which only produce “monophonic” (or single-tone) noises, imitated the droid's sounds with less accuracy and musicality.

The differing abilities stem from physical variations in the birds' “syrinx”—a unique vocal organ that sits at the base of the avian windpipe. “Starlings can produce two sounds at once because they control both sides of the syrinx independently,” says study co-author Nick Dam, an evolutionary biologist at Leiden University in the Netherlands. “Parrots are physically incapable of producing two tones simultaneously.”

It isn't exactly known why different species developed differing control over their syrinx. “Likely, some ancestor of songbirds happened to evolve the ability to control the muscles on both sides of the syrinx, and this helped them in some way,” says University of Northern Colorado biologist Lauryn Benedict, who wasn't involved in the study but sometimes works with its authors. One of the leading explanations involves mating; the better at singing a male songbird is, the more females he attracts.

Though the study is “a really elegant way of approaching this question of whether the starlings versus the parrots are capable of producing the same sound with the same accuracy,” it doesn't fully address how much training or rewards the birds received, says Nicole Creanza, an evolutionary biologist at Vanderbilt University, who also wasn't involved with the research.

Benedict agrees that the researchers could work with the public to do more tightly controlled trials. (And she and other scientists are looking for public submissions of other examples of parrots imitating sounds for their "The Many Parrots Project") “A wider sample would be really neat,” she says, “and they could test all kinds of different sounds, not just R2-D2!”

Before a car crash in 2008 left her paralysed from the neck down, Nancy Smith enjoyed playing the piano. Years later, Smith started making music again, thanks to an implant that recorded and analysed her brain activity. When she imagined playing an on-screen keyboard, her brain–computer interface (BCI) translated her thoughts into keystrokes — and simple melodies, such as ‘Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star', rang out1.

The rise of brain-reading technology: what you need to know

But there was a twist. For Smith, it seemed as if the piano played itself. “It felt like the keys just automatically hit themselves without me thinking about it,” she said at the time. “It just seemed like it knew the tune, and it just did it on its own.”

Smith's BCI system, implanted as part of a clinical trial, trained on her brain signals as she imagined playing the keyboard. That learning enabled the system to detect her intention to play hundreds of milliseconds before she consciously attempted to do so, says trial leader Richard Andersen, a neuroscientist at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.

Smith is one of roughly 90 people who, over the past two decades, have had BCIs implanted to control assistive technologies, such as computers, robotic arms or synthetic voice generators. These volunteers — paralysed by spinal-cord injuries, strokes or neuromuscular disorders, such as motor neuron disease (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) — have demonstrated how command signals for the body's muscles, recorded from the brain's motor cortex as people imagine moving, can be decoded into commands for connected devices.

But Smith, who died of cancer in 2023, was among the first volunteers to have an extra interface implanted in her posterior parietal cortex, a brain region associated with reasoning, attention and planning. Andersen and his team think that by also capturing users' intentions and pre-motor planning, such ‘dual-implant' BCIs will improve the performance of prosthetic devices.

Andersen's research also illustrates the potential of BCIs that access areas outside the motor cortex. “The surprise was that when we go into the posterior parietal, we can get signals that are mixed together from a large number of areas,” says Andersen. “There's a wide variety of things that we can decode.”

The ability of these devices to access aspects of a person's innermost life, including preconscious thought, raises the stakes on concerns about how to keep neural data private. It also poses ethical questions about how neurotechnologies might shape people's thoughts and actions — especially when paired with artificial intelligence.

Meanwhile, AI is enhancing the capabilities of wearable consumer products that record signals from outside the brain. Ethicists worry that, left unregulated, these devices could give technology companies access to new and more precise data about people's internal reactions to online and other content.

Ethicists and BCI developers are now asking how previously inaccessible information should be handled and used. “Whole-brain interfacing is going to be the future,” says Tom Oxley, chief executive of Synchron, a BCI company in New York City. He predicts that the desire to treat psychiatric conditions and other brain disorders will lead to more brain regions being explored. Along the way, he says, AI will continue to improve decoding capabilities and change how these systems serve their users. “It leads you to the final question: how do we make that safe?”

Consumer neurotech products capture less-sophisticated data than implanted BCIs do. Unlike implanted BCIs, which rely on the firings of specific collections of neurons, most consumer products rely on electroencephalography (EEG). This measures ripples of electrical activity that arise from the averaged firing of huge neuronal populations and are detectable on the scalp. Rather than being created to capture the best recording possible, consumer devices are designed to be stylish (such as in sleek headbands) or unobtrusive (with electrodes hidden inside headphones or headsets for augmented or virtual reality).

Still, EEG can reveal overall brain states, such as alertness, focus, tiredness and anxiety levels. Companies already offer headsets and software that give customers real-time scores relating to these states, with the intention of helping them to improve their sports performance, meditate more effectively or become more productive, for example.

AI has helped to turn noisy signals from suboptimal recording systems into reliable data, explains Ramses Alcaide, chief executive of Neurable, a neurotech company in Boston, Massachusetts, that specializes in EEG signal processing and sells a headphone-based headset for this purpose. “We've made it so that EEG doesn't suck as much as it used to,” Alcaide says. “Now, it can be used in real-life environments, essentially.”

And there is widespread anticipation that AI will allow further aspects of users' mental processes to be decoded. For example, Marcello Ienca, a neuroethicist at the Technical University of Munich in Germany, says that EEG can detect small voltage changes in the brain that occur within hundreds of milliseconds of a person perceiving a stimulus. Such signals could reveal how their attention and decision-making relate to that specific stimulus.

Although accurate user numbers are hard to gather, many thousands of enthusiasts are already using neurotech headsets. And ethicists say that a big tech company could suddenly catapult the devices to widespread use. Apple, for example, patented a design for EEG sensors for future use in its Airpods wireless earphones in 2023.

Yet unlike BCIs aimed at the clinic, which are governed by medical regulations and privacy protections, the consumer BCI space has little legal oversight, says David Lyreskog, an ethicist at the University of Oxford, UK. “There's a wild west when it comes to the regulatory standards,” he says.

In 2018, Ienca and his colleagues found that most consumer BCIs don't use secure data-sharing channels or implement state-of-the-art privacy technologies2. “I believe that has not changed,” Ienca says. What's more, a 2024 analysis3 of the data policies of 30 consumer neurotech companies by the Neurorights Foundation, a non-profit organization in New York City, showed that nearly all had complete control over the data users provided. That means most firms can use the information as they please, including selling it.

Responding to such concerns, the government of Chile and the legislators of four US states have passed laws that give direct recordings of any form of nerve activity protected status. But Ienca and Nita Farahany, an ethicist at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, fear that such laws are insufficient because they focus on the raw data and not on the inferences that companies can make by combining neural information with parallel streams of digital data. Inferences about a person's mental health, say, or their political allegiances could still be sold to third parties and used to discriminate against or manipulate a person.

“The data economy, in my view, is already quite privacy-violating and cognitive- liberty-violating,” Ienca says. Adding neural data, he says, “is like giving steroids to the existing data economy”.

Several key international bodies, including the United Nations cultural organization UNESCO and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, have issued guidelines on these issues. Furthermore, in September, three US senators introduced an act that would require the Federal Trade Commission to review how data from neurotechnology should be protected.

While their development advances at pace, so far no implanted BCI has been approved for general clinical use. Synchron's device is closest to the clinic. This relatively simple BCI allows users to select on-screen options by imagining moving their foot. Because it is inserted into a blood vessel on the surface of the motor cortex, it doesn't require neurosurgery. It has proved safe, robust and effective in initial trials4, and Oxley says Synchron is discussing a pivotal trial with the US Food and Drug Administration that could lead to clinical approval.

Elon Musk's neurotech firm Neuralink in Fremont, California, has surgically implanted its more complex device in the motor cortices of at least 13 volunteers who are using it to play computer games, for example, and control robotic hands. Company representatives say that more than 10,000 people have joined waiting lists for its clinical trials.

At least five more BCI companies have tested their devices in humans for the first time over the past two years, making short-term recordings (on timescales ranging from minutes to weeks) in people undergoing neurosurgical procedures. Researchers in the field say the first approvals are likely to be for devices in the motor cortex that restore independence to people who have severe paralysis — including BCIs that enable speech through synthetic voice technology.

As for what's next, Farahany says that moving beyond the motor cortex is a widespread goal among BCI developers. “All of them hope to go back further in time in the brain,” she says, “and to get to that subconscious precursor to thought.”

Last year, Andersen's group published a proof-of-concept study5 in which internal dialogue was decoded from the parietal cortex of two participants, albeit with an extremely limited vocabulary. The team has also recorded from the parietal cortex while a BCI user played the card game blackjack (pontoon)6. Certain neurons responded to the face values of cards, whereas others tracked the cumulative total of a player's hand. Some even became active when the player decided whether to stick with their current hand or take another card.

Both Oxley and Matt Angle, chief executive of BCI company Paradromics, based in Austin, Texas, agree that BCIs in brain regions other than the motor cortex might one day help to diagnose and treat psychiatric conditions. Maryam Shanechi, an engineer and computer scientist at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, is working towards this goal — in part by aiming to identify and monitor neural signatures of psychiatric diseases and their symptoms7.

BCIs could potentially track such symptoms in a person, deliver stimulation that adjusts neural activity and quantify how the brain responds to that stimulation or other interventions. “That feedback is important, because you want to precisely tailor the therapy to that individual's own needs,” Shanechi says.

Shanechi does not yet know whether the neural correlates of psychiatric symptoms will be trackable across many brain regions or whether they will require recording from specific brain areas. Either way, a central aspect of her work is building foundation models of brain activity. Such models, constructed by training AI algorithms on thousands of hours of neural data from numerous people, would in theory be generalizable across individuals' brains.

Despite the remarkable success of mRNA vaccines, improving the translational efficiency of mRNA therapeutics remains a critical challenge to their widespread clinical application. Here we systematically evaluate chemical modifications to improve the translational activity and stability of uncapped mRNA. We employ a primarily chemistry-based synthetic approach, which is crucial for the position-specific introduction of chemical modifications, enabling detailed structure-activity relationship studies, hitherto unattainable with conventional methods. A pivotal innovation herein is the introduction of 2´-F modification at the first nucleoside of the codon in the open reading frame, which significantly bolsters the stability of mRNA without compromising its translation. Additional modifications at the 5´-UTR and poly(A) tail with other types of nucleoside and phosphate analogs also exemplify the importance of terminal modifications for improved translation. Precise control of these modification patterns achieves higher peptide expression than conventional in vitro-transcribed mRNA. These findings offer a unique framework for designing effective mRNA-based therapeutics.

Research on the development of messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics using mRNA as drug molecules has been greatly accelerated by the successful application of mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-21,2. mRNA therapeutics3,4 have a variety of applications, including vaccines against infectious diseases using viral and bacterial antigens5, cancer vaccines based on cancer cell-specific antigens6,7, and protein replacement therapy for diseases caused by genetic mutations8,9,10. Compared to protein replacement therapy using proteins as drug molecules, mRNA therapeutics offer advantages in terms of molecular design simplicity, predictability of molecular properties, and inherent eukaryotic post-translational modifications vital for protein function. Unlike conventional DNA-based gene therapy, on the other hand, mRNA therapeutics do not require transport to the nucleus for gene expression, have little risk of genome integration, and allow for transient expression of therapeutic effects, enabling better therapeutic control.

The following issues are generally recognized for the future application of mRNA therapeutics as general-purpose medicines3,5: mRNA in vivo stability, insufficient translational activity, induction of undesired immune responses, and devising effective delivery methods to target tissues and cells. Among these challenges, introducing non-canonical chemical modifications has shown promise in enhancing mRNA stability and translational activity and reducing immune responses11,12,13. Improvement of mRNA function by introducing chemical modifications has been studied mainly for the 5´-cap, and various cap derivatives have been developed to improve stability by imparting decapping resistance14,15,16,17,18,19, as well as for tool-oriented applications20,21,22. Although less common, modifications to the poly(A) tail23,24,25 and region-specific thiophosphate modifications in the 5´-untranslated region (UTR)26 have been explored to enhance protein production. In addition, the use of non-canonical nucleobases27,28,29,30 can effectively mitigate undesired immune responses31,32,33,34,35 triggered by exogenous mRNA. It is well recognized that the use of these modified nucleobases plays a significant role in the success of mRNA vaccine development against SARS-CoV-2. These studies underscore the potential of chemical modifications and the use of non-canonical structures to address the challenges of mRNA therapeutics. However, conventional enzyme-based preparative methods for mRNA greatly limit the types and patterns of chemical modifications that can be introduced. Modification of the ribose ring would significantly improve biological stability, as exemplified by oligonucleotide therapeutics36,37,38,39 such as antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and siRNAs. However, there are two significant challenges in applying the same concept to mRNAs. One is that ribose modifications in ORFs, as known from examples such as 2´-O-methyl (2´-OMe)30,40,41, would significantly decrease translational activity. The second issue is the synthetic method used for chemically modified mRNA. mRNA is basically synthesized by enzymatic transcription, but even in transcription using engineered RNA polymerases, the types of sugar-modified nucleosides that can be introduced are very limited42,43,44,45,46. In addition, when preparing mRNA with a single composition, as in pharmaceutical applications, substitutions with modified nucleosides are inevitably made throughout for the specific nucleobase. In other words, by using conventional transcription-based synthetic methods, it is impossible to introduce position-specific chemical modifications to maximize both mRNA stability and translational activity.

On the other hand, our group has also been conducting research to solve issues in mRNA therapeutics from different aspects, including nano-structure design of mRNAs such as circular mRNA47,48,49,50, introduction of chemical modifications such as specific phosphorothioate modification to 5´-UTR26, development of cap analogs for in vitro transcription (IVT) that enable purification of capped mRNAs with high-purity and translational activity51, and chemical capping reaction on RNA for complete chemical synthesis of mRNA52.

Here, we show the possibility of introducing chemical modifications into the ribose scaffold of nucleosides, especially those in the open reading frame (ORF) regions, as a pioneering approach for developing effective mRNAs (Fig. 1A). Chemically modified mRNAs developed in this study are prepared by first synthesizing the corresponding RNA oligonucleotides using phosphoramidite chemistry and then concatenating these RNA fragments by enzymatic or chemical ligation reactions (Fig. 1B) to obtain full-length mRNAs. This method enables the introduction of many different types of chemical modifications in various patterns in the synthesis of RNA fragments and allows precise evaluation of their effects on the translational activity and stability of the mRNA.

A Concept of the study. B Two ligation methods employed in this study.

First, to screen for modification patterns, we designed a sequence of 91 nucleotides (nt) uncapped RNA that could be directly synthesized without ligation, and evaluated its translation activity in a cell-free translation system with HeLa lysate (Fig. 2A). The sequence consisted only of 5´-UTR (β-globin UTR)53 and ORF, and was designed to encode Flag-His6 peptide52 to perform a sandwich ELISA for the evaluation of translational activity. As modifications, 2´-fluoro (2´-F), 2´-OMe, 2´-O-methoxyethyl (2´-O-MOE), locked nucleic acid (LNA), and DNA etc., were selected. mRNA modified with 2´-OMe at both ends (NK002) showed 4-fold higher translational activity than unmodified RNA (NK001) (Fig. 2B). Other types of modifications, such as 2´-F, LNA, DNA, 2´-O-MOE, and phosphorothioate, were also examined for possible introduction into the mRNA terminus (Fig. S1A). LNA (NK011) modification resulted in a significant loss of translational activity (Fig. S1B), whereas DNA (NK012) and 2´-O-MOE (NK009) modifications maintained translational activity, including additional phosphorothioate modifications (NK014 and NK015), as well as for 2´-OMe (NK013) (Fig. S1C). Next, the introduction of the 2´-F modification into a specific position in the codon unit was tested; the modification was specifically introduced at the codon's first, second, or third nucleoside over the ORF (NK003, NK004, NK005) (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, while the translational activity of mRNA with the modification at all of the second or third nucleoside in the codon unit (2nd NC, 3rd NC) was suppressed by nearly 30–50 % level, the modification at the first nucleoside in the codon unit (1st NC) did not have strong deleterious effects on translational activity. This translational acceptability of the 2´-F modification of the 1st NC was also observed in another sequence (67 nt mRNA coding Flag-His6). (Fig. S2). In contrast, other types of sugar modifications showed a negative effect on translation (Fig. 2C) when all of the 1st NC were modified, translation was suppressed in the case of the 2´-OMe (NK006) and 2´-O-MOE (NK007) modifications, and a nearly 50% reduction was observed for the deoxyribose modification (NK008).

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

Subsequently, screening for the optimum chemical modification patterns of the terminal region (6 nt at the 5´ terminus and 3 nt at the 3´ terminus) was performed with a longer mRNA (145 nt) encoding three repeats of FLAG peptide and His-Tag (Fig. 3A). The mRNAs were prepared by chemical or enzymatic ligation reactions between the 5´ side 80 nt and the 3´ side 65 nt RNA fragments that were prepared using an automated oligonucleotide synthesizer. The method of ligation (enzymatic or chemical) was determined based on the relative positions of the ligation point and chemically modified sites. For substrates without chemical modifications near the ligation point, enzymatic ligation was selected based on the reported tolerance of sugar-modified nucleoside analogs to ligation by RNA ligase 254. In cases where the region around the ligation point contains 2´-modified nucleosides, the chemical ligation method was selected with the 3´ end of the 5´side -RNA fragment on being 2´-F, 3´-phosphate, and the 5´ end of the 3´ side- RNA fragment being a hydroxyl group. The conditions for the chemical ligation method were slightly modified from those previously reported55,56 In the case of RNA prepared by chemical ligation, the target ligated RNA strand was confirmed by LC-MS analysis (Fig. S3). 2´-F modification on the terminus increased peptide production (NK024) to some extent, while LNA and BNA-NC (N-Me) modification significantly restrained translation (NK026, NK027) (Fig. 3B). 2´-O-MOE modification showed a positive effect on the translation (NK025) with a similar level as 2´-OMe modification (NK023), and the positive effect was further improved by the additional phosphorothioate modification to the terminal region (NK028).

Both standard errors of “NK034” and “NK035” (D) were 0 and described as “+”.

Based on these findings, terminal modification of mRNA with polyadenine (poly(A)) tails was evaluated. To the 145 nt RNA with 2´-O-MOE modification at the terminus, 20 nt of poly(A) with various modification types was also prepared (Fig. 3C). The types of modifications tested on poly(A) were as follows: 2´-F modification for every 2 nt (NK030), cross modification with 2´-F and 2´-OMe (NK031), complete modification with 2´-OMe (NK032), and 2´-O-MOE (NK033). The terminal 3 nt of the modified poly(A) was set as 2´-O-MOE with a phosphorothioate linkage. Evaluation of the translational activity revealed that the addition of non-modified poly(A) (20 nt) increased the translated peptide amount, and the positive effect was further enhanced by these modifications on poly(A), with 2´-F modification for every 2 nt (NK030) being slightly better than the others (Fig. 3D). In contrast to the ORF cases, various modifications were accepted on poly(A) without loss of translational activity. To evaluate whether the modified poly(A) tail retained the intrinsic biological function, we measured the binding affinity of Poly(A)-Binding Protein (PABP) to chemically-synthesized poly(A) fragments based on the Surface Plasmon Resonance binding assay. The 5´-biotinylated poly(A) fragments were immobilized onto a streptavidin-coated sensor chip, and the response rate for PABP binding was measured (Fig. S13). As expected, PABP exhibited strong binding to unmodified poly(A) RNA (NK065; KD = 4.4 ± 0.3 × 10−10 mol/L), while it did not bind to the randomized sequence (C5A5U5G5; NK067).57 Regarding chemically modified fragments, modified poly(A) showed a weaker binding to PABP than unmodified poly(A) (NK066; KD = 4.8 ± 0.2 × 10−9 mol/L); however, the binding was superior to nonspecific binding observed for C5A5U5G5 sequence with the same modification pattern (NK068; KD = 4.4 ± 0.1 × 10−8 mol/L). These results supported the binding of NK066 to PABP. A previous study reported that sugar modifications of poly(A) impair PABP binding.58 Nevertheless, the combined effect of sugar and PS modification has not been addressed, suggesting the potential for a positive effect from this combination. The biological function of chemically modified poly(A) tail was also evaluated by the subsequent translation competition assays. The translation from synthesized mRNA with modified poly(A) (NK041) was competitively inhibited by the addition of poly(A) RNA fragment, while it remained unchanged by the addition of poly(C) (Fig. S14).

To clarify the effect of chemical modification of mRNA at various positions, 5´-UTR, ORF, and poly(A), mRNA samples with different modification sites and patterns were prepared (Fig. 3E), and their translational activities were compared in HeLa cell extracts. The samples tested were as follows: RNA with no modification (NK034), modified only at the 5´-UTR (NK035), ORF (NK036), poly(A) (NK037), modified both at the 5´-UTR and poly(A) (NK038) and modified over all regions (NK039). As shown in Fig. 3F, each modification to either the 5´-UTR, ORF, or poly(A) increased translational activity, and a stronger increment of the translated peptide was observed by the modification of ORF and poly(A) than that for the 5´-UTR. Interestingly, the combination of the 5´-UTR and poly(A) modification (NK038) counteracted the positive effects of each modification, and the additional modification of the ORF enhanced translation (NK039). Additionally, LC-MS/MS analysis was performed for the extracted peptide after the in vitro translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate, and both non-modified (NK034) and chemically modified (NK041) mRNA administration predominantly afforded the target peptide MS peak (Fig. S4), suggesting no negative effect on mRNA decoding due to chemical modification in the ORF.

After identifying the candidates for the optimum modification patterns, four mRNA samples were designed and synthesized with various modification patterns for each region (Fig. 4A). All four samples contained ribose modification in the ORF except for the start codon, 2´-F modification at the 1st NC, and the level of chemical modification on both terminals was changed among these four samples, as shown in Fig. 4A. Evaluation of the translational activity of these modified mRNA revealed that, as the level of terminal modification increased, the amount of translated peptide slightly decreased (NK030 vs. NK031, NK040, NK041) (Fig. 4B). The time course of translation was also evaluated over 30 min (Fig. 4C). While mRNA without any modifications (NK034) showed maximum translation at 5 min after administration, the modified RNA (NK030, NK031, NK041) increasingly produced the peptide over 30 min, with moderately modified RNA (NK030) showing the highest translation level at every time point.

B The concentration of encoded peptides from each mRNA obtained after 30 min of reaction with the HeLa cell lysate in vitro translation system (n = 3 biological replicates). C, D The time course of the concentration of translated peptides (C, n = 3 biological replicates) and remaining RNA (D, n = 4 biological replicates) obtained 30 min reaction of HeLa cell lysate in an in vitro translation system. E, F Time course of the concentration of encoded peptide from HeLa cells after lipofection using messengerMAX (E) and electroporation (F) of each mRNA (n = 3 biological replicates). G Time course of the remaining RNA after electroporation in HeLa cells (n = 4 biological replicates). Data are presented as the mean ± standard error. The statistically significant differences between “NT” and “37 °C, 30 min” (D) in two-tailed, unpaired Student's t-tests were marked as follows. n.s., p > 0.05; #p  <  0.05; ##p  <  0.01; ###p  <  0.001. Statistically significant differences for each mRNA from “NK034” (B, C, E–G) in one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's test are marked as follows. n.s., p > 0.05; *p  <  0.05; **p  <  0.01; ***p  <  0.001. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

The stability of mRNA in HeLa lysates was evaluated using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) for the reaction mixture (Fig. 4D). While the unmodified RNA (NK034) showed fast clearance from the mixture, the modified mRNAs (NK030, NK031, and NK041) stably remained in the reaction mixture without degradation for 30 min at 37 oC. While the amount of remaining mRNA was nearly comparable for the three types of modified mRNAs, there was a significant difference in the amount of the translation product (Fig. 4C). These results suggest that moderate and high levels of chemical modification at the terminus improved the stability of the mRNA, but the latter negatively influenced its translational activity.

The effect of introducing chemical modifications to each region of the mRNA on translation activity was also evaluated in a cell-based system (NK034 – NK039, Fig. S6B). Consistent with the results in the cell lysate (Fig. 3F), the introduction of modifications to the ORF led to a strong enhancement in translation activity (NK036 and NK039). Additional modification both in the 5´-UTR and poly(A) cooperatively augmented the translational activity (NK039), which was more obvious than the case with the cell lysate system (Fig. 3F). The 2'-F modification at the 1st NC of start codon did not affect the translation activity of the mRNA, demonstrating it could be incorporated throughout the ORF (NK041 vs. NK052, Fig. S6D). The time course of translation was evaluated using HeLa cells over an extended incubation period of up to 48 h. In the case of lipofection (Fig. 4E), mRNAs that were highly modified in the poly(A) moiety (NK031 and NK041) afforded the highest amount of translational product over 48 h compared to mRNAs with the other two types of modification (NK030 and NK040). Notably, the translation level of the unmodified mRNA (NK034) was significantly lower than that of the modified mRNAs, clearly reflecting the results of the stability evaluation (Fig. 4D). While the modification level in the 5´-UTR region had little effect on the translation level in the case of mRNAs with a higher level of modification in the poly(A) region (NK031 vs. NK041), a lower level of modification of the 5´-UTR resulted in better translation activity for mRNA with less modification of the poly(A) region (NK030 vs. NK040). In the case of electroporation (Fig. 4F), the trend was somewhat different from that observed in the lipofection cases; mRNA with high modification at both termini (NK041) showed the highest level of translation without decreasing the peptide amount over 24 h. Both these experiments suggested that modification of the poly(A) region was more critical for increasing the translation amount than that on the 5´-UTR region in the cellular system.

The amount of mRNA remaining in HeLa cells after electroporation was quantified by RT-qPCR (Fig. 4G). The result was consistent with the translation level in the electroporation experiment (Fig. 4F); the mRNA was more stable as the level of chemical modification increased. In addition, no cytotoxicity was observed for the transfection of both non-modified and chemically modified mRNA (Fig. S7, NK034, 030, 031, 040, 041) at the concentration range evaluated for translational activity.

Various reasons can be considered for the different optimal modification patterns observed in HeLa cell lysates and cell lines. One possible explanation for this is the varying impact of the mRNA degradation system. Specifically, in the HeLa cell lysate system, where the effect of mRNA degradation was relatively minor, the introduction of extensive chemical modifications at both ends of the mRNA inhibited translation. In contrast, in the cell system, the significant influence of the mRNA degradation system suggests that resistance to degradation plays a major role in determining translational activity.

A similar trend in the positive effect of the chemical modification was also observed in other cell lines, where mRNA was administrated to hAoSMCs (human aortic smooth muscle cells) by electroporation, and the time course of the translation was evaluated (Fig. S5A). In addition, the versatility of the design strategy was confirmed by other mRNA sequences, the ones encoding the same hybrid peptide, three repeats of FLAG and HisTag, but with different 5´-UTR sequences (Fig. S5B, C), and the others encoding a different peptide composed of FLAG and Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) (Fig. S5D). Notably, the latter has a different ORF sequence, but the 2´-F modification on the 1st NC except for the start codon effectively increased translational activity, demonstrating the broad applicability of the effects of the modification on translational activity. For the FLAG-EGF construct, the time course of translation was also evaluated. By introducing chemical modifications into mRNA (NK051), it was found that the peak translation activity was around 12 h, and the half-life from the maximum translation level was more than 36 h (Fig. S5E). Considering a previous report that the stability of recombinant EGF in several buffer solutions is limited to a few hours,59 it could be suggested that mRNA, particularly chemically modified mRNA, has advantages over direct peptide administration. Nonetheless, further investigation is required to test whether chemically modified mRNA administration with established delivery methods such as LNP60,61,62 afforded more sustained pharmacological effects in vivo than direct administration of recombinant EGF.63

Finally, the stability and translation activity of chemically modified and canonical mRNA prepared by IVT (NK060) with co-transcriptional capping with CleanCap were compared (Fig. 5A). The capping ratio of the co-transcriptionally capped mRNA was 84% based on DNAzyme-mediated 5´-terminus cleavage reaction (Fig. S12A). No damage to a cap structure nor structural change during isolation by dPAGE was confirmed by LC-MS analysis of the isolated mRNA (Fig. S12C). Based on the above studies, chemically modified uncapped RNA (NK041) was designed to have intensive chemical modification at both termini and 2´-F modification at the 1st NC in ORF except for the start codon and was entirely prepared by chemical method; the 5´ side 80 nt RNA fragment with 3´ phosphate terminus was chemically ligated with the 3´-side 85 nt RNA fragment with a 5´ -hydroxy terminus. As additional control samples, m1Ψ-modified co-transcriptionally capped IVT RNAs with 20 nt (NK062) and 80 nt (NK063) poly(A) were also prepared.

A Design and sequence of chemically synthesized mRNAs and in vitro-transcribed mRNAs. B Time course of concentration of remaining RNA after incubating with diluted mouse serum (n = 3 biological replicates). C, D Time course of concentration of encoded peptide from HeLa cells after lipofection using messengerMAX (n = 4 biological replicates) (C) and electroporation (D) of each mRNA (n = 4 biological replicates). The data were represented as the mean. The statistically significant differences for each mRNA from “NK041” (B–D) in one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's test were marked as follows. n.s., p > 0.05; *p  <  0.05; **p  <  0.01; ***p  <  0.001. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

For stability evaluation, mRNA was incubated in 1.6% diluted mouse serum at 37 oC, and the amount of remaining mRNA was evaluated by RT-qPCR (Fig. 5B), where a calibration curve was created for each mRNA sample to offset the effects of modifications on reverse transcription (Fig. S8E). IVT mRNA (NK034) degraded rapidly, leaving less than 5 % of the sample after 90 min. Introducing m1Ψ and extending poly(A) length were both effective, as these modified mRNAs remained at approximately 6.0% (NK060) and 21% (NK063) at the same time point. In contrast, chemically modified RNA without a cap (NK041) showed higher stability; ~48% of RNA remained after 90 min of incubation.

In terms of translational activity, while non-modified mRNAs (NK034 and 060) afforded a very low translation level, regardless of the presence or absence of a 5´ cap (Figs. 5C, D, S8A), m1Ψ-modified capped mRNAs with 20 nt (NK062) and 80 nt (NK063) poly(A) enhanced the translational activity, especially at earlier time points, with longer poly(A) effectively enhancing the activity. Chemically modified uncapped mRNA (NK041) stably expressed much higher levels of the peptide in HeLa cells over 24–48 h compared to other mRNA (Fig. 5C, D). Notably, m1Ψ-modified mRNA with longer poly(A) showed higher translational activity than chemically modified mRNA at the early time point, but its decay was faster than that of NK041. After 24 h, NK041 showed 6–16 fold higher translational activity than NK063, suggesting a strong stabilizing effect by chemical modification (Fig. 5C). The same trend in translational level was observed in the electroporation system (Fig. 5D). These results clearly demonstrate that appropriate chemical modifications enhance peptide production from mRNA in cellular systems.

Immune responses (IL6, TNF, and IL1B) upon the administration of mRNA were also evaluated (Fig. S8B–D). Chemically synthesized mRNAs (NK034 and NK041), as well as m1Ψ-modified mRNAs (NK062 and 063), did not show significant immunogenicity, while non-modified IVT mRNA (NK060) showed a high levels of immune-related gene expression, especially at higher doses. Uncapped IVT mRNA (NK056-059) showed the same trend of immune responses (Fig. S9A, D-I), and these results were consistent with the dsRNA detection results (Fig. S10).

The effect of cap introduction on this short mRNA sequence was also evaluated using several control samples (NK056-NK063, Fig. S9A-C); In terms of translational activity, only capped and m1Ψ-modified mRNA (NK062 and NK063) showed a significant level of peptide expression 5 h after administration. Collectively, no immune response was observed with m1Ψ-modified mRNA, and the introduction of the cap surely enhanced translational activity. In other words, in this construct, if the influence of the immune response is eliminated, enhancement of translational activity by the introduction of the cap can be observed. Furthermore, the effect of cap introduction on chemically modified mRNA was evaluated (Fig. S11). An improvement in translational activity by the introduction of modifications in capped mRNA (NK055 vs. NK053, 054) was confirmed. On the other hand, in comparisons among chemically modified mRNAs, uncapped mRNA (NK052) showed higher translational activity than capped mRNA (NK055), suggesting certain contribution of cap-independent translation mechanisms.64,65,66 Cap-dependency of translation activity on sugar-modified synthetic mRNA remains a topic for future investigation.

In conclusion, we have systematically demonstrated the effectiveness of chemical modification of the sugar moiety of ribonucleosides in enhancing peptide production from uncapped mRNA. The pivotal discovery in this study is that the position-specific 2´-F modification in the 1st NC (first nucleoside in the codon unit) could be accepted without reducing the translational activity and effectively the biological stability of the mRNA. Augmented by the additional chemical modification on both termini, the chemically modified mRNA, even without a 5´ cap, yielded a greater amount of peptide over a longer duration than the IVT-derived canonical mRNA. Site-specific chemical modification for a high level of translation was enabled by chemical synthesis of the RNA fragments. Ligation reactions with these RNA fragments allowed for the preparation of chemically modified mRNA exceeding 200 nt in length. Building on the SAR insights from this study, we are pursuing the development of highly efficacious mRNA therapeutics. Owing to their high and long-lasting activity, chemically modified mRNA might provide novel therapeutic options that are difficult to achieve with IVT-derived mRNAs in the evolving area of mRNA therapeutics, such as cancer vaccines7, protein replacement, and tissue regeneration therapies.

RNA fragments and splint DNAs for enzymatic or chemical ligation reactions were purchased from Gene Design or Hokkaido System Science, where they were synthesized using standard phosphoramidite methods. The oligonucleotides used in this study are listed in Tables S1–S6. The dPAGE analysis of the evaluated RNA samples is presented in Figs. S15–S19. The concentration of the oligonucleotide and ligated mRNA was measured by NanoDrop2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using the extinction coefficient calculated by OligoAnalyzer (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.).

The structures of the solid-phase synthesized oligonucleotides were determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) using an Agilent 6120 series single quadrupole LC-MS system (Agilent Technologies). Liquid chromatography was performed using an ACQUITY BEH C18 column (1.7 μm, 2.1 × 50 mm; Waters) with buffers A (8.6 mmol/L trimethylamine and 100 mmol/L hexafluoroisopropanol in water) and B (methanol). The column temperature was 60 °C. The gradient ran from 10% to 90% B over 9.0 min (for Tables S1–S3) or 18.0 min (for Fig. S3) at 0.60 mL/min. Water injections served as blanks. Mass spectrometry was performed in negative ion mode with a negative capillary voltage of 3000 V, full scan range m/z 500–2000. The acquired MS data were deconvoluted and reviewed using Agilent OpenLab CDS ChemStation Edition (Version C.01.09). All data were obtained from single measurements of each sample (n = 1).

A mixture containing RNA fragments No.1 and 2 (each 10 nmol, final conc. of 50 μmol/L) (Table S2) and splint DNA (10 nmol, final conc. of 50 μmol/L) (Table S3) in T4 RNA Ligase 2 Reaction Buffer (New England BioLabs, NEB) was heated at 90 °C for 5 min and then gently cooled to room temperature. Then, T4 RNA Ligase 2 (10 units) and 60% PEG6000 (final conc. of 15%) were added and incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. The ligated RNAs were purified using preparative 5% denaturing PAGE and isolated using the crush-and-soak method to obtain the ligated products. The gel extraction was performed with 1× TE buffer and desalting with Amicon 10 K (Merck Millipore) and ethanol precipitation was performed and the mRNA was stored in 1 mmol/L sodium citrate (pH 6.5) buffer. For the preparation of some lots of NK023 and NK064, the following RP-HPLC purification was performed. After the enzymatic ligation, the crude samples were treated with Recombinant DNase I and then purified by HPLC with XBridge Oligonucleotide BEH C18 OBD Prep Column (130Å, 2.5 μm, 10 mm × 50 mm) and gradient buffer containing 0–50% MeCN, 100 mmol/L hexylammonium acetate in H2O. The yield of each ligated mRNA is shown in Table S4.

A mixture containing RNA fragments Nos. 56 and 57 (each 10 nmol, final conc. of 50 μmol/L) (Table S2), splint DNA (10 nmol, final conc. of 100 μmol/L) (Table S3) in 100 mmol/L NaCl was heated at 90 °C for 5 min and gently cooled to room temperature. ZnCl2 solution (final conc. of 5 mmol/L) and N-Cyanoimidazole (final conc. of 5 mmol/L) in DMSO were added and incubated at 30 °C for 20 h. The ligated uncapped RNA was purified using a NAP-10 column and preparative 5% denaturing PAGE. The yield of each ligated mRNA is shown in Table S4. Generally, the ligation yield was moderate (approximately 40 %, Fig. S20); however, the final isolated yield remained low, mainly because of sample loss during the isolation process, which could be overcome by scaling up the reaction.

5´capped RNA fragment No. 69 was prepared from starting fragment No. 68 based on a previously described chemical capping reaction.52 After lyophilizing the RNA solution, the following solvents and reagents were added at the final concentrations listed below, and the solution was incubated at 55 °C for 3 h: DMSO (10 µmol/L RNA), 7-methylguanosine 5´-diphosphate imidazolide (10 mmol/L), and N-methyl imidazole (1.3 mol/L). After the reaction, the mixture was diluted with MQ and desalted using Amicon 10 K, followed by isopropanol precipitation. The product was purified using reverse-phase HPLC (Column: YMC-Triart Bio C18, Eluent: A: 50 mmol/L TEAA, 5% MeCN, B: MeCN, Linear gradient 0–40 % B over 30 min). Nearly quantitative capping was confirmed by dPAGE analysis (Fig. S12B). LC-MS analysis of the isolated fragment was performed; calculated: 26877.6, observed: 26880.7. The condition was shown below; Column: ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 Column, 130 Å, 1.7 µm, 2.1 mm × 50 mm; Column temp. of 60 °C.; Linear gradient of 5–30% over 20 min; Solvent A: MeOH; Solvent B: 8.6 mmol/L TEA/100 mmol/L HFIP solution; and Flow rate: 0.3 mL/min.

The obtained fragment No. 69 was determined by LC-MS as described above. RNA fragments Nos. 69 and 70 were chemically ligated and then treated with Recombinant DNase I as described above. The reaction mixture was then purified by HPLC with a COSMOSIL RNA-SEC-1000 Packed Column (7.5 × 300 mm) and 20 mmol/L phosphate buffer (pH 7.4).

Template DNA for IVT was prepared by PCR using pUC57amp/G-3×FLAG-6×His-DHFR as the template. The plasmid and PCR primer was purchased from IDT and Sigma-Aldrich, respectively. These sequences are listed in Table S5.

To prepare 5′ capped mRNA by co-transcriptional capping, the following PCR primers were used: FW-AGG and RV-PA20 (for preparation of poly(A)20) or FW-AGG and RV-PA80 (for preparation of poly(A)80). The PCR mixture consisted of 0.25 μmol/L primers, 0.25 ng/μL pUC57amp/G-3×FLAG-6×His-DHFR vector, 1× PCR buffer of PrimeSTAR MAX DNA Polymerase (Toyobo). The mixture was subjected to the thermal cycling reaction as follows: 98 °C, 30 s, (98 °C, 10 s, 55 °C, 5 s, 72 °C, 5 s) × 30 cycles, 72 °C, 5 min. The reaction was treated with 100 U/μL DpnI and then analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, and gel-excised dsDNA was purified with the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN).

Transcription reactions were conducted with MEGAScript T7 Transcription Kit (Invitrogen) based on the manufacturer's protocol. A reaction mixture containing 1 ng/μL DNA (PCR product) and 8 mmol/L NTPs with or without 6 mmol/L CleanCap AG was incubated at 37 °C for 6 h. To the reaction mixture was added Turbo DNase I, which was further incubated at 37 °C for 15 min, and then purified using the Monarch RNA Cleanup Kit (NEB). The purified capped-RNA was then treated with 5 U/μL Antarctic Phosphatase Enzyme (NEB) and 1×Antarctic Phosphatase Buffer at 37 °C for 1 h. The obtained mRNA was analyzed by dPAGE, and gel-purified mRNA was extracted using buffer. mRNA was recovered by alcohol precipitation.

To prepare 5′ capped mRNA by post-transcriptional enzymatic capping, FW-GGG and PA20 were used as PCR primers. PCR was performed with the KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMixPCR Kit (Roche) based on the manufacturer's protocol. Transcription reactions were conducted using the MEGAScript T7 Transcription Kit, 4 ng/μL DNA, and 9 mmol/L NTPs. After DNase I treatment and purification, the resultant RNA was capped with Vaccinia Capping System (NEB) and ScriptCap 2'-O-Methyltransferase Kit (CELLSCRIPT) based on the manufacturer's protocol. The reaction mixture containing 0.5 μg/μL RNA, 0.1 mmol/L SAM, 0.5 mmol/L GTP, 0.5 U/μL Vaccinia Capping Enzyme, 2.5 U/μL 2'-O-Methyltransferase, 2 U/μL RNase Inhibitor, and 1× Capping Buffer was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and then purified with Monarch RNA Cleanup Kit. Purified capped-RNA was then treated with Antarctic Phosphatase and gel-purified. The other procedures were the same as those described above. The sequences of the prepared mRNAs are described in Table S6.

Chemically synthesized uncapped mRNAs were preheated at 90 °C for 3 min and cooled to 4 °C before the translation assay and degradation evaluation. The in vitro translation reaction was performed using a 1-Step Human Coupled IVT Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The reaction mixture (10 μL) containing each concentration of mRNA and 0.8 U/μL Murine RNase Inhibitor was incubated at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by incubation at 72 °C for 5 min.

The in vitro translation reaction was performed using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The reaction mixture (10 μL) containing 300 nmol/L mRNA, 10 μmol/L poly(A) fragments and 1.6 U/μL Murine RNase Inhibitor was incubated at 37 °C. After incubation, reaction mixture was diluted in 0.1 mol/L Carbonate buffer (pH 9.4) to stop the reaction.

The vector for expressing human PABP, pCS-6xHis/TEV/hPABPC1[NM_002568.4], was constructed and packaged by VectorBuilder Inc. with vector IDs VB231222-2539wqp. The protein was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) Star cells (Invitrogen) and cell pellets were lysed with B-PER (Thermo Fisher Scientific) containing 125 units/mL benzonase (Merck). Nucleic acids bound to PABP were digested by benzonase and further removed with poly(ethyleneimine) precipitation. The proteins were purified using cOmplete His-Tag Purification Resin (Roche), followed by a Superdex 200 increase GL 10/300 column (Cytiva).

The binding affinity of human PABP to the poly(A) fragments was determined using Biacore T200 (GE Healthcare). 5'-biotinylated poly(A) fragments were purchased from Gene Design. The poly(A) fragments were captured on streptavidin-coated sensor chip (GE Healthcare) in a running buffer (10 mmol/L HEPES, 600 mmol/L NaCl, 3 mmol/L EDTA, 0.005% v/v surfactant P20 pH 7.4). Recombinant PABP was injected for 2 min and allowed to dissociate for 3 min. The flow-cell surface was regenerated with 0.1% SDS for 2 min to completely remove PABP bound to the poly(A) fragments. Kinetic parameters were determined using 1:1 binding model.

The translational activity of each uncapped mRNA was evaluated in vitro using HeLa cells. In the lipofection experiment, cells were seeded and cultured at 1.0 × 104 cells/well in RPMI1640 medium containing 10% FBS in 96-well cell culture plates at 37 °C and 5% CO2. After overnight cultivation, 10 μL/well of transfection reagent containing each concentration of mRNA and 0.3% Lipofectamine MessengerMAX Transfection Reagent diluted with Opti-MEM were added to 40 μL/well of the cultured cells. After 5 h of transfection, the culture supernatant was removed, replaced with RPMI1640 medium containing 10% FBS, and the cells were cultivated. Cultured cells were then washed with ice-cold D-PBS(−) and lysed with 20 μL/well iScript RT-qPCR Sample Preparation Reagent (Bio-Rad) containing 2% Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (EDTA free) (Nacalai Tesque). For the FLAG-EGF mRNA experiment, 0.45% Lipofectamine MessengerMAX was used. Electroporation of mRNAs was performed using the Nucleofector 96-well Shuttle System (Lonza) and the SE Cell Line 96-well Nucleofector Kit (Lonza). Twenty microliters of reaction mixture containing each concentration of mRNA, 2.0 × 105 HeLa cells, Nucleofector Solution and Supplement 1 was pulsed with FF-150 condition, and then seeded and cultivated at 5.0 × 104 cells/well. Cell lysis was performed under the same conditions as the lipofection experiment.

Electroporation of uncapped human primary aortic smooth muscle cells (hAoSMC) (Lonza) was performed using the Nucleofector 96-well Shuttle System and P1 Primary Cell 96-well Nucleofector Kit (Lonza). hAoSMC were pulsed with FF-130 condition. After electroporation, 2.0 × 104 cells/well were seeded and cultivated with Smooth Muscle Cell Growth Medium 2 (Lonza) and lysed as described above. The translational activity of each mRNA was evaluated as described in the section on assays using HeLa cells.

FLAG-His tag peptides in the translation reaction were measured using sandwich ELISA. The following standard peptides were purchased from COSMO-BIO: 1×FLAG-His6: NH2-MDYKDDDDKGGHHHHHH-COOH and 3×FLAG-His6: NH2-MDYKDDDDKIIDYKDDDDKGGDYKDDDDKHHHHHH-COOH. Maxisorp 96-well plate (Sigma-Aldrich) was coated with 3 μg/mL of Anti-His-Tag Antibody (Proteintech) in 0.1 mol/L Carbonate buffer (pH 9.4) and then blocked with 3% BSA-TBST. The plate was washed with 1×TBST, and then each translation reaction and standard peptides in 3% BSA-TBST were added. After 1 h of incubation, a washed plate was added with 0.01 % Monoclonal ANTI-FLAG M2-Peroxidase (HRP) Ab produced in mice (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in 3% BSA-TBST. After washing, the plate was developed with 1-Step Ultra TMB-ELISA and then stopped with 0.5 mol/L sulfuric acid. Abs. 450 subtracted by abs. 570 was measured using a spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad).

To evaluate immune stimulation by each mRNA transfected into in vitro cultured cells, cDNA was prepared with the SuperPrep Cell Lysis & RT Kit for qPCR (Toyobo) from cultured cells 5 h after the transfection of mRNAs. The procedure was based on the manufacturer's protocol. The gene expression of IL6 (Hs00174131_m1), TNF (Hs00174128_m1), and IL1B (Hs01555410_m1) was evaluated by RT-qPCR using TaqMan probes and TaqMan Gene Expression Master mix (Applied Biosystems) and normalized by GAPDH (Hs02786624_g1) expression.

The viability of HeLa cells at 24 h after lipofection with 30 nmol/L chemically modified mRNA was evaluated with the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega) based on the manufacturer's protocol.

The concentration of the remaining mRNA in the translation reaction was measured using RT-qPCR. The sequences and structures of the primers (Sigma-Aldrich) and TaqMan probes (Applied Biosystems) are described below. RT primer: 5' -TCAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGTTTG −3', FW primer: 5' -GAATACAAGCTACTTGTTCTTTT −3', RV primer: 5' -ATCTTGTCGTCGTCGTCCTT −3', FAM-MGB probe: 5'-FAM-CAGCCACCATG-NFQ-MGB-3'. Reverse transcription of mRNA was performed using the iScript Select cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The reaction mixture contained 0.2 μmol/L RT primer, and the translation reaction was diluted with RNase/DNase-free water containing 0.2 U/μL Recombinant RNase Inhibitor. RT-qPCR of the obtained cDNAs was performed with Taqman qPCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and QuantStudio 12 K Flex Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems), as described below. Twenty microliters of reaction mixture containing 4 μL of cDNA, 1.65 μmol/L FW primer, 1.40 μmol/L RV primer, 0.10 μmol/L FAM-MGB probe and 1×reaction master mix were subjected to the thermal cycling reaction as follows: 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min, (95 °C, 15 s, 60 °C, 1 min) × 50 cycles.

The stability of each mRNA in mouse serum was measured as described below. Ten microliters of reaction mixture containing 1.6% mouse serum and 1 μmol/L of each mRNA in THE RNA Storage Solution (Ambion) was incubated at 37 °C for 0, 15, 30, and 60 min, and then 1.2 U/μL of Recombinant RNase inhibitor was added to stop the degradation.

The remaining mRNAs in the reaction mixture were measured using RT-qPCR, as described in the section of “Evaluation of mRNA stability in vitro”.

dsRNA content in each mRNA sample was detected with a Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) ELISA kit (K1 based) (Exalpha). Poly(I:C) HMW (InvivoGen) was used as the standard dsRNA. The general procedure was based on the manufacturer's protocol.

Chemically synthesized mRNAs were translated using a rabbit reticulocyte in vitro translation system (Promega) at 37 °C for 30 min. The translated peptides were purified with an anti-FLAG antibody (Millipore). LC-MS analysis of the peptides and synthetic standards (NH2-MDYKDDDDKIIDYKDDDDKGGDYKDDDDKHHHHHH-COOH) was performed by Medical ProteoScope (Kanagawa, Japan). Peptides were resuspended in [TFA]:[ACN]:[H2O] = 0.1:2:98 (%vol).

Analysis was conducted using an Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano LC system coupled to a Q Exactive Orbitrap MS (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Chromatography used a Nano HPLC Capillary Column (3.0 µm, 75 µm × 15 cm) with buffers A (0.1% formic acid) and B (0.1% formic acid, 90% acetonitrile). The gradient ran from 5% to 95% B over 50 min at 350 nL/min. Water injections served as blanks.

Mass spectrometry was performed in positive ion mode with a capillary temperature of 250 °C, full scan range m/z 310–1500, and resolution 70,000 (MS) and 17,500 (MS/MS). Lock mass correction used m/z 391.28429 and 445.12003. Data were reviewed with Xcalibur Qual Browser (v4.2.47). Extracted ion chromatograms targeted m/z 859.89–860.89 (pentavalent ion).

MS/MS data were analyzed with Mascot (Matrix Science) using standard settings; however, MS/MS spectra are not shown. Peptide identifications were confirmed by high-resolution LC-MS and comparison with synthetic standards. Technical replicates ensured reproducibility.

Little red dots (LRDs) are a high redshift galaxy population. Despite their high number densities, their nature is still uncertain. Here we present CANUCS-LRD-z8.6, a spectroscopically confirmed little red dot at a spectroscopic redshift of zspec = 8.6319, hosting an active galactic nucleus. Its spectrum exhibits broad Hβλ4863 Å emission, high-ionization lines (C iv, N iv]), high electron temperature, which are indicative of active galactic nucleus activity, and low metallicity (Z < 0.1−0.2Z⊙). The inferred black hole mass, \({M}_{{{{\rm{BH}}}}}=1.{0}_{-0.4}^{+0.6}\times 1{0}^{8}\,{{{{\rm{M}}}}}_{\odot }\), poses strong constraints on current black hole formation models and simulations. Additionally, its black hole is over-massive relative to its host, deviating from local MBH − M* relations, suggesting an early, rapid black hole growth preceding that of its galaxy. CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 may represent an evolutionary link between early massive black holes and the luminous quasars observed at z = 6.

LRDs appear as a heterogeneous galaxy population in which both active galactic nuclei (AGN) and star formation can contribute to their observed light. Some LRDs have been classified as AGN hosts based on the detection of broad emission in Balmer lines1,2,3, and some show evidence for evolved stellar populations with clear Balmer breaks4. Moreover, it has been found that, independent of the specific AGN contribution adopted, the LRDs' black holes (BHs) are significantly overmassive relative to their host galaxies compared to the local MBH–M* relation5, and their formation channels remain unclear. Understanding how these massive BHs formed in such compact galaxies as early as redshift z = 8.6 remains a key question1,6.

Here, we present the discovery of the LRD CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 at zspec = 8.6319 ± 0.0005 (object ID: 5112687; RA = 11:49:33.82, DEC = 22:20:59.16), which opens a new pathway to the understanding of this intriguing population of LRDs. Indeed, this source is unique in terms of its BH and host galaxy properties, being the only high-z source to date that shows evidence of broad line emission and high-ionization lines. Throughout the paper, we adopt the ΛCDM cosmology from ref. 7: H0 = 67.4 km s−1 Mpc−1, Ωm = 0.315, and ΩΛ = 0.685. Thus, the angular scale is \(4.802\,{{{\rm{kpc}}}}/{{{\rm{arcsec}}}}\) at z = 8.3.

As part of the Canadian NIRISS Unbiased Cluster Survey (CANUCS) program, JWST/NIRCam and NIRSpec observations of the cluster MACS J1149.5+2223 allowed us to identify and study CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 (Fig. 1). The galaxy was first selected as a high-redshift “double break” galaxy8, and it also meets the criteria set by ref. 9 on spectral slopes and size to be classified as an LRD. The upper limit derived for the half-light radius of this source is very stringent, r < 70 pc (see Section “Observations and data reduction”). Hereafter quantities are corrected for the derived magnification of CANUCS-LRD-z8.6, μ = 1.07 (see Section “Observations and data reduction”), unless otherwise specified.

The scale of the image is reported in the lower left corner. The source observed rightward our target is a foreground galaxy at \({z}_{{{{\rm{phot}}}}}=0.4{9}_{-0.07}^{+0.05}\). Source data are provided on Zenodo (see “Data Availability” section).

As shown in Fig. 1d, the detection of broad emission in Hβ (S/N = 6), with \({{{{\rm{FWHM}}}}}_{{{{\rm{H}}}}\beta,broad}=420{0}_{-500}^{+600}\,{{{\rm{km}}}}\,{{{{\rm{s}}}}}^{-1}\) (see Section “Continuum and emission line fitting”), indicates the presence of an AGN. The non-detection of broad emission in [O III]λ5008 refutes the scenario of the high gas velocities arising from outflowing material. From locally-calibrated empirical relations10 using both the broad Hβ luminosity and the L5100 Å continuum luminosity, we derive consistent values for the BH mass of \({M}_{{{{\rm{BH}}}}}=1.{0}_{-0.4}^{+0.6}\times 1{0}^{8}\,{{{{\rm{M}}}}}_{\odot }\). This picture is further supported by the detection of high ionization lines of N iv] and C iv (both at S/N = 3; Fig. 1e). These are typical indicators of Type II AGNs11, and have been seen with JWST in galaxies identified as Type II AGNs12,13. For CANUCS-LRD-z8.6, the detection of both N iv] and C iv cannot be explained as arising from star formation [as in ref. 14, see Section C iv, N iv]λλ1483,1486, Nv, and \(\left.[{{{\rm{Ne}}}}{{{\rm{v}}}}]\right]\). Moreover, the combination of very high-velocity broad line gas (>1000 km s−1) and high-ionization narrow emission lines with high photo-ionization energy (about 50–60 eV) constitutes a strong AGN signature1,15,16. When compared with other spectroscopically well-studied objects at z > 71,14,17,18,19,20,21,22,23, CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 stands out given that it is one out of the two only sources showing both broad emission in Hβ and the detection of N iv] and C iv, but the other one being at lower z (J1007-AGN at z=7.3;23). At the same redshift, the LRD found by ref. 1 has similar BH mass to our target, but no evidences of high-ionization lines and lower stellar mass (see also the discussion in Section “Properties of the host galaxy”). Moreover, the BH mass of CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 is at least one order of magnitude higher than the majority of spectroscopically confirmed AGN LRDs at z ~5–79,24, with just three LRDs with comparable BH mass at lower z ~ 5–7. Notably, compared to the AGN candidate GN-z11 at z = 10.6, which also exhibits N iv] and C iv emission17,18, CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 hosts a supermassive black hole (SMBH) approximately 100 times more massive than that of GN-z11, despite being just 150 Myr older.

As anticipated above, the properties of CANUCS-LRD-z8.6's host galaxy also add interesting details to the picture, specifically in terms of the composition of the gas and the co-evolution between the SMBH and its host. No Lyman-α emission has been detected, and the shape of the spectrum around Lyman-α seems to indicate the presence of a damping wing25,26,27. Since the auroral [O III]λ4364 emission line has been detected with S/N = 4, albeit blended with a stronger Hγ line, we can determine the electron temperature (Te) and the gas-phase metallicity. We find an extreme [O III]λ4364/[O III]λ5008 ratio (about  − 1 dex) even after subtracting an additional broad Hγ component: in particular, we assumed the broad Hγ to have the same width of the observed broad Hβ, and the ratio of the peak fluxes of the broad Hγ over broad Hβ to be either equal to case B recombination (Test 1) or equal to the ratio of the fluxes of the narrow components (Test 2). These extreme [O III]λ4364/[O III]λ5008 ratios are found to be suggestive of high densities as in the densest part of the narrow line region of Type I AGNs28. Using pyneb models, we derive \({T}_{e}=40,00{0}_{-12,000}^{+16,000}\) K, which is 2-4 times higher than in star-forming galaxies29,30, but consistent with other AGNs1,31. Even when considering the maximum Hγ contribution, the electron temperature is at least  > 20, 000 K. In particular, similarly to our source, ref. 1 found extreme high electron temperature in an LRD at z = 8.5 also showing broad Hβ emission with FWHM = 3439 km s−1. These features led the authors to identify the LRD as a broad-line AGN, even in the absence of high ionization UV emission/absorption lines (e.g. C iv, N iv], N V). Therefore, such a high electron temperature further supports the presence of an AGN in CANUCS-LRD-z8.6. Moreover, when comparing the [O III]λ4364/Hγ versus [O III]λ5008/[O III]λ4364 line ratio diagram as done in21,32, our target occupies the region of higher electron temperatures and displays elevated ratios of [O III]λ4364/Hγ compared to local AGNs, similar to the z = 7.15 AGN type I's host galaxy ZS7, identified as a broad-line AGN21. There are two non-exclusive possible explanations for the [O II]3727 non-detection. (1) Given the high-ionization inferred for CANUCS-LRD-z8.6, it is likely that [O II]3727 is almost completely ionized and so detected as [O III]λ5008. This hypothesis resonates with the generally lower [O III]λ5008/[O II]3727 ratios found by JWST in galaxies at z > 5 [e.g. refs. 33]. While luminous AGN can show substantial [O II]3727 emission, in general the low-ionization zone in AGNs is associated with high-energy, small cross-section photons, chiefly X-rays [e.g., refs. 34]. However, for LRD AGNs, the X-ray detection is very low35,36,37, naturally explaining the lack of [O II]3727. (2) The other possibility is that of emission dominated by high-density regions38; with electron densities above about 104 cm3, capable of collisional suppression of the [O II]3727 emission, but still too low density to equally suppress [O III]λ5008. Finally, a more speculative hypothesis is that [O III]λ5008 may trace a compact, high-surface brightness source, while [O II]3727, if more diffuse, would be below our detection threshold. The stringent upper limit on the [O II]3727 emission line provides strong constraints on the metallicity content of this LRD. Indeed, the 3σ upper limit inferred from the Te-direct method is low, Z ≲ 0.2Z⊙ (see Section “Electron temperature and metallicity”).

These results are also consistent with those derived from “OHNO” diagnostic, shown in Fig. 2, which relates the [O III]5008/Hβ with [Ne III]λ3869/[O II]3727 to distinguish between the star-forming or AGN nature of galaxies at low- and high-z39,40,41. Also in this case, the observed “OHNO' ratios (yellow star) clearly indicate low metal content (Z ≲ 0.1Z⊙) and high ionization parameter (\(\log (U) \sim -1.5\)) when comparing with photo-ionization models. CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 shares similar metallicity content as the galaxy 04590 at z = 8.497 presented in ref. 42 (red square in Fig. 2). 04590 is reported to have a comparable [O III]/Hβ ratio to z = 0 dwarf galaxies, given its stellar mass of \(\log {M}_{*} \sim 8.5\pm 0.3\). The scenario for our target changes significantly, given that CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 stellar mass is about 1 dex higher than 04590.

The fiducial result for CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 is shown as a yellow star. The lighter yellow square and circle are the results for the line ratios of CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 from Test 1 and Test 2, respectively, derived by adding a broad Hγ component (see text and Supplementary Methods). Line ratios are dust-corrected. The maximum correction for [Ne III]λ3869/([Ne III]λ3869+Hζ+Hη) due to the blend of [Ne III]λ3869, He Iλ3889, Hη and Hζ is  ≈ 0.2 dex (see Section “Line blending and contamination correction”). Errorbars represent standard deviation. Left: the [O III]λ5007/Hβ ratio as a function of the [Ne III]λ3869/[O II]λ3727 ratio (“OHNO” diagnostic) for our target and other observations as described in the legend and in  Supplementary Methods (Section “Electron temperature and metallicity”). Contours are reported as bars in the legend. Right: overlaid to our results (yellow markers as in the legend of the left panel) for the “OHNO” diagnostic are the AGN photoionization models of ref. 11 at hydrogen densities \(\log n[{{{{\rm{cm}}}}}^{-3}]=2.0\) (gray scale grid) and \(\log n[{{{{\rm{cm}}}}}^{-3}]=4.0\) (coloured-scale grid). The grid shows the variation of the ionization parameter and metallicity (color scales on the right-hand side of the figure, same limits are adopted for gray scale). To guide the eye, lighter colors represent lower metallicity and higher ionization. Y-axis is the same as the right panel. Source data are provided on Zenodo (see “Data Availability” section).

Indeed, by performing Spectral Energy distribution (SED) fitting using both photometry and spectroscopy with Bagpipes43,44, including an AGN component, we derive a stellar mass of \({M}_{*}=4.{5}_{-2.9}^{+1.1}\times 1{0}^{9}\,{{{{\rm{M}}}}}_{\odot }\) (errors include possible variation of the SED and dust modeling, see Section “Spectral energy distribution fitting”). As shown in Fig. 3, in terms of stellar mass, CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 is indeed the most massive AGN host at z > 7. When comparing both the [O III]/Hβ and [Ne III]λ3869/[O II] ratios as a function of M*, in the local UNiverse SDSS galaxies exhibit a bimodal distribution42. At \(\log {M}_{*}\lesssim 10\), both line ratios are anti-correlated with stellar mass, forming the so-called “main sequence”. In the higher mass regime, AGN activity becomes dominant, leading to elevated line ratios. Due to its large stellar mass, CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 falls within the region of AGN host galaxies, unlike 04590 (see Figure 6 in ref. 42), although it occupies the lower-metallicity end of this distribution. Similarly to other C iv emitters, such as RXCJ2248-ID14, GHZ220, and the z = 7 LRD COS-6696424, CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 is characterized by intense star formation in a very dense and metal-poor environment. Our observations of CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 also reveal nitrogen enrichment alongside the carbon one, which seems to be in tension with the evidence of low metallicity. A possible explanation could be found in the recent discovery of metallicity stratification in AGN hosts45. In this picture, the nitrogen and carbon enrichment arise form the broad line region (BLR) surrounding the AGN. This enriched gas in the BLR could be explained by tidal disruption events or accelerated chemical evolution in the very central region. However, given the compact size of the BLR46, the metallicity enhancement in the BLR does not have a strong impact on the metallicity derived from the overall larger galaxy. Indeed, the low metallicity content found in the galaxy is possibly arising from a recent or ongoing accretion of pristine gas also fueling the star formation, which is high as inferred from the SED fitting (\(\log ({{{\rm{sSFR}}}}/{{{{\rm{yr}}}}}^{-1})=[-8.0,-7.9]\)). This picture reconciles the observed low metallicity in CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 as arising from the total galaxy with the evidence of N and C enhancements as deriving from the central AGN. It is also worth to highlight that, when considering the most stringent constrain obtained for CANUCS-LRD-z8.6's metallicity (Z < 0.1Z⊙), CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 is one of the most metal-poor source per given stellar mass observed at these high redshifts [see the mass-metallicity relation shown in ref. 29].

The results for CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 (yellow star) are compared with 4 < z < 7 AGNs (gray dots) from ref. 55, a compilation of QSOs at 4 < z < 7187, a compilation of AGNs at 4 < z < 7 (gray squares) discovered by other JWST surveys at high-z4,36,188,189,190, AGNs at z ~ 7 (red edged squares21,24), AGNs at z > 8.5 (blue edged squares1,41,58), GNz-11 at z=10.6 (blue edged dot,55) and with local scaling relations [dashed gray, solid red and dotted yellow lines, respectively from refs. 51,191,192]. Error bars represent standard deviation. Source data are provided on Zenodo (see “Data availability” section).

We hypothesize a physical model of the CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 system which can account for all of the observations and the derived properties. When modeling its SED including the AGN component, we find that the AGN dominates the UV continuum. Combined with the observed broad Hβ and high-excitation UV lines, this suggests our sight-line to the AGN is not heavily dust-obscured. On the other hand, the fit prefers a lower AGN contribution in the rest-optical regime, instead accounting for the red continuum with more dust obscuration of the stellar component. Given the very compact size of the source and the significant SFR inferred from the modeling (about 50 M⊙ yr−1), it is reasonable to infer that the bulk of the stellar light is embedded in stellar birth clouds, leading to high obscuration. Ref. 47 shows that even small amounts of dust can cause significant obscuration in LRDs given their compactness. Altogether, this points to a highly compact system undergoing an episode of star formation with a high dust covering fraction in which a highly energetic AGN has cleared a sight-line in our direction48,49,50. This perhaps points toward CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 being a more evolved system than some other observed LRDs that exhibit less massive BHs and host galaxies, on its way to becoming a system resembling the brightest quasars at z = 6 rather than the lower luminosity AGNs discovered by JWST in this redshift range (see also Section “Comparison with simulations and semi-analytical models”). Figure 4 shows a visual representation of this physical configuration.

Components include a UV-bright AGN with either a patchy dusty torus or a sight-line cleared by feedback. Stars are obscured by a high dust covering fraction, likely due to a combination of the current episode of star formation and the compact size. Source data are provided on Zenodo (see “Data availability” section).

LRDs' BHs are found to be significantly overmassive relative to their host galaxies compared to the local MBH − M* relation5. Given the SED-inferred M*, it is possible to place CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 on the MBH−M* plane. As presented in Fig. 3, CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 stands above the MBH − M* local relations (in particular the one for local AGNs, in red;51), indicating faster evolution of the BH compared to its host galaxy. This is possibly the result of the BH experiencing fast growth and suppressing star formation via efficient feedback, a scenario that is also supported by recent simulations52 and observations of quiescent over-massive black holes53. We caution here that these observations may be affected by the combined effects of selection biases (i.e., finite detection limit and limited survey area) and uncertainties in the MBH and M* estimates54. Furthermore, it has been found that outliers from the local MBH−M* are instead consistent with the local relation MBH−σ, where σ is the stellar velocity dispersion53,55. This suggests that MBH−σ is a more fundamental and universal relation than MBH−M*, and should be preferred when σ measurements are available. This is not the case for CANUCS-LRD-z8.6, and we therefore consider the estimate of M*, as inferred from the SED fitting.

We are witnessing the growth of an SMBH of 108 M⊙ in a very compact and massive galaxy (M* ≃ 5 × 109 M⊙ in r < 70 pc), unlike any other sources at the same redshift. The SMBH in CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 has a comparable mass to that of GS-9209 at z ~ 4.7, with the critical difference that GS-9209 is quenched, having halted star formation by z ~ 756. Additionally, the stellar mass of CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 appears to be approaching that of the massive post-starburst galaxy RUBIES-UDS-QG-z7 (M* ~1.7 × 1010 M⊙,57), which is already quiescent at z ~ 7. These observations suggest that feedback from SMBHs as massive as CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 could play a pivotal role in quenching star formation in galaxies by z ~ 7.

The high BH mass of CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 at z = 8.6 imposes stringent constraints on the formation pathways of SMBHs, challenging standard models and simulations. When examining potential growth trajectories under constant accretion rates (dotted lines in Fig. 5), the mass of CANUCS-LRD-z8.6's BH suggests an origin in massive seed mechanisms58,59, accreting close to the Eddington limit, and/or in PopIII star remnants [e.g., refs. 60,61,62,63,64,65], accreting at super-Eddington rates. While lower-mass seeds are easier to account for, sustaining a constant or super-Eddington accretion rate over the BH's history has been largely ruled out by numerous studies [e.g., refs. 66,67]. Notably, if the derived accretion rate of CANUCS-LRD-z8.6's SMBH at z=8.6 (λEdd = 0.1, blue dotted line) remained constant over time, it would not be sufficient for the BH to reach the observed mass. We refer to  Supplementary Methods for a more exhaustive comparison among semi-analytical models (SAMs) and numerical simulations with different prescriptions, and we summarize here our main findings. In SAMs, Super-Eddington accretion results to be essential to reproduce the black hole mass of CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 at its redshift. The CAT model68, which includes both light and heavy seeds, showcases multiple tracks that successfully assemble 108M⊙ at z = 8.669 (the most massive one is shown in Fig. 5 with a cyan solid line). These models also predict BHs over-massive with respect to their host galaxies as compared to the local relation, as a result of short bursts of Super-Eddington accretion70. Interestingly, the stellar masses predicted by their models at z ~ 9 are consistent with the low-mass end of the estimated stellar mass for CANUCS-LRD-z8.6. Most numerical simulations employing standard prescriptions cannot replicate CANUCS-LRD-z8.6's BH mass, since AGN feedback prevents early BH growth. In particular, the original recipe of the Feedback Acting on Baryons in Large-scale Environments (FABLE) zoom-in simulations falls short by one order of magnitude (purple dotted track in Fig. 5). FABLE suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations are based upon the framework of the successful Illustris project but improve upon the agreement with observations on scales larger than galaxies71. However, modifications promoting earlier BH growth to form BHs of MBH = 1010 M⊙ at z ~ 672, such as QSO J0100+280215, allow to explain the existence of CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 (purple solid track in Fig. 5; see Section “Comparison with simulations and semi-analytical models”). As such, CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 is a possible progenitor for QSOs like J0100+2802, challenging standard theoretical models. The discovery of CANUCS-LRD-z8.6, featuring one of the highest BH masses and the highest stellar mass at z > 8, provides essential constraints for simulations and theoretical models. Current models need further improvements in the description of BH-galaxy (co)-evolution through more refined prescriptions in terms of black hole seeding, star formation physics, AGN feedback and BH accretion modeling, in order to provide a coherent framework able to reproduce at the same time QSOs at z < 7, the new population of over-massive AGNs at 4 < z < 7, and the extreme SMBHs at z > 8, such as CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 and UNCOVER 204661. As such, CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 represents a fundamental piece to complete this puzzle.

The growth history of CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 assuming a constant accretion rate corresponding to the observed luminosity (λEdd = 0.1), Eddington capped accretion (λEdd = 1), and super-Eddington accretion (λEdd = 1.5), as blue, teal and light green dotted lines, respectively. Solid purple and dashed red lines are simulations72, dashed blue64 and solid cyan69 lines are semi-analytical models with different prescriptions, as detailed in Supplementary Methods, that can (cannot) reproduce the BH mass of CANUCS-LRD-z8.6. We show for comparison only QSOs and AGNs having BH masses derived from broad lines (as a purple dot15, and as gray dots1,21,24,36,41,55,187), and two AGN candidates at z > 6 [as gray triangles18,41]. In particular, the source next to our target is the AGN LRD discovered by ref. 1, showing broad Hβ emission but no high-ionization emission lines. Error bars represent standard deviation. Source data are provided on Zenodo (see “Data availability” section).

We utilize data from the CANUCS NIRISS GTO Program #120873, which targets five strong-lensing cluster (CLU) fields: Abell 370, MACS J0416.1-2403, MACS J0417.5-1154, MACS J1149.5+2223 (hereafter MACS1149, z = 0.543), and MACS J1423.8+240474,75. Because NIRCam and NIRISS operate in parallel, each cluster field includes both a NIRCam and a NIRISS flanking field. Our source of interest is located in the MACS1149 cluster field, which was observed with the following NIRCam filters: F090W, F115W, F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W, F410M, and F444W, each with an exposure time of 6.4 ks. To complement these observations, we also incorporate archival HST imaging from the HFF program76. The CANUCS image reduction and photometry procedures are described in detail in refs. 77,78,79,80, while the methodology for point-spread function (PSF) measurement and homogenization is presented in ref. 81. Cluster galaxies and intra-cluster light (ICL) are modeled and subtracted to prevent contamination of the photometry following82. Briefly, the NIRCam data are processed using a modified version of the Detector1Pipeline (calwebb_detector1) from the official STScI pipeline, together with the jwst_0916.pmap JWST Operational Pipeline (CRDS_CTX). The reduction steps include astrometric alignment of the JWST/NIRCam exposures to the HST/ACS reference frame, sky subtraction, and drizzling to a common pixel scale of 0.04″ using version 1.6.0 of the Grism Redshift and Line Analysis software for space-based slitless spectroscopy (Grizli;83). PSFs are empirically derived by median stacking bright, isolated, non-saturated stars, following the methodology of ref. 81, and all images are subsequently degraded to match the F444W resolution for photometry. Source detection and photometric measurements are carried out using the Photutils package84 on a χmean detection image created by combining all available NIRCam images.

First selected as a high-z double break galaxy8, our target is classified as an LRD following the criteria on UV and optical slopes and compactness given by ref. 9.

The CANUCS program also includes NIRSpec low-resolution prism multi-object spectroscopic follow-up using the Micro-Shutter Assembly (MSA85). Details of the NIRSpec processing are given in ref. 8. NIRSpec data have been reduced using the JWST pipeline for stage 1 corrections and then the msaexp86 package to create wavelength-calibrated, background-subtracted 2D spectra. A 1D spectrum is extracted from the 2D using an optimal extraction based on the source spatial profile. The redshift (and its uncertainty) of CANUCS-LRD-z8.6, z = 8.6319 ± 0.0005, was determined by performing a non-linear least-squares fit simultaneously to the Hβ, [O III]λ4960 and [O III]λ5008 emission lines. Each line was modeled with a single Gaussian and the ratio of [O III]λ4960 to [O III]λ5008 was fixed by atomic physics.

The MACS1149 cluster strong lensing model was derived using Lenstool software87 and the catalog of 91 multiple images with spectroscopic redshifts, derived from CANUCS data77. As the distance of the LRD from the cluster centre is large (approximately 3 arcmin), the contribution from the cluster lens model alone is small (μ = 1.060 ± 0.003). However, the LRD is only 0.54 arcsec away from a foreground galaxy 5112688 at photometric redshift \({z}_{{{{\rm{phot}}}}}=0.4{9}_{-0.07}^{+0.05}\) and stellar mass \(\log ({M}_{*}/{M}_{\odot })=8.0\pm 0.1\) (derived with DenseBasis,88). We evaluated the combined magnification in two ways. First, we constructed a Lenstool model containing the cluster model and the foreground galaxy at cluster redshift z = 0.54 (we verified that using a slightly lower photometric redshift for the galaxy did not affect the results). We modeled the foreground galaxy as a singular isothermal sphere, where the integrated velocity dispersion (\(\sigma=4{0}_{-2}^{+4}\,{{{\rm{km}}}}\,{{{{\rm{s}}}}}^{-1}\)) was derived from \(\log {M}_{*}\) and the stellar mass Tully-Fisher relation89. We find that the combined model still yields only a low magnification of \(\mu=1.1{3}_{-0.01}^{+0.02}\). Alternatively, we computed the magnification by modeling the galaxy as a dual pseudo-isothermal ellipse90, following the scaling relations of other cluster members and by using its F160W magnitude of 25.28 ± 0.03 (we verified that the magnitude uncertainty has a negligible impact on magnification). The scaling relations for parameters were constrained with Lenstool in the inner cluster regions. This method gives a more modest total magnification of \(\mu=1.06{6}_{-0.002}^{+0.004}\). We take the latter value as our best magnification estimate \(\mu=1.0{7}_{-0.01}^{+0.08}\). Considering that the uncertainty derived from different estimates is small, we correct masses, luminosities, and sizes presented in this work for CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 for a constant μ = 1.07.

Supplementary Fig. 1 shows the photometry of our target in 10 bands. We fit CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 with Galfit91 and confirm that it is spatially unresolved in all filters (see Supplementary Fig. 1). From Galfit modeling, the object is consistent with a point source in all observed NIRCam filters. We perform a more refined fit accounting for the effect of gravitational lensing with Lenstruction92,93,94 to place a more stringent limit on the physical size. Lenstruction performs forward modeling accounting for lensing and the instrumental point spread function. We use lensing maps from the main cluster model, which yields a conservative magnification estimate of μ = 1.056, and we choose a clear single star as PSF reference. We use 20 mas image in the F150W filter as this filter comes with the smallest PSF size while still retaining enough flux. The half-light radius of the object results to be smaller than  <0.015 arcsec with 95% confidence. This corresponds to an upper limit on the physical half-light radius of 70 pc.

The emission lines are fitted to the 1D spectrum of CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 using single or multiple Gaussian components (see below for details). LRDs often have a characteristic continuum shape, with a blue colour in the rest-frame UV and red in the rest-frame optical. This is why we split the continuum emission of CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 into two parts modeled by two independent power laws. In particular, we divide the spectrum in two parts visually setting λrest,sep = 3400 Å, wavelength at which the continuum slope changes sign. Any choice for λrest,sep in the range 3300–3600 Å led to perfectly consistent results. Although our spectrum does not display a prominent break at this location, we note that the wavelength at which our spectrum changes slope is similar to that of breaks observed in other LRDs4,36 which have been interpreted as Balmer breaks. We discuss a possible physical interpretation of the spectral shape in Section “Spectral energy distribution fitting”. We fit the two parts (UV and optical) of the spectrum separately (see Fig. 1). The spectrum is fitted, accounting for the well-known variation of prism resolution with wavelength (see below).

The continuum shows the typical V-shape, having βopt = 0.96 ± 0.24 in the optical and βUV = −1.7 ± 0.1 in the UV regime, which is in line with the spectral shape of other photometric and spectroscopically confirmed LRDs9,24. No Lyman-α emission has been detected, and the shape of the spectrum around Lyman-α seems to indicate the presence of a damping wing25,26,27. The analysis of Lyman-α damping wing is beyond the scope of this paper. Therefore, we exclude the part of the spectrum with λrest < 1320 Å, avoiding any contamination from a possible damping wing given the damping wing's size commonly found in the literature (about 2000–3000 km s−1, see e.g., refs. 95,96). Above λrest = 1320 Å, any detected emission line has been modeled with a single or multiple Gaussian components in case of line blending or broad emission.

The [OIII]λλ4959,5007 doublet is modeled by fixing the ratio between the peak fluxes (peak[O III]λ4959/peak[O III]λ5007 = 0.335) and the rest-frame wavelength separation (Δλ = 47.94 Å) of the two lines, while assuming the same FWHM for both components. Similarly, the [Ne III]λ3869 and [Ne III]λ3967 doublet is fitted by adopting a fixed flux ratio of 0.301 between the latter and the former, and a rest-frame wavelength separation of 98.73 Å, again using a common FWHM for both lines. These constraints reduce the number of free parameters for each of the [O III] and [Ne III]λ3869 doublets to three. Given the prism resolution, the [Ne III]λ3869 line remains blended with Hζ, Hη, and He Iλ3889 (see the following section).

Apart from these two doublets, there are six other emission lines detected: N iv], C iv, Hδ, Hγ, [O III]λ4368, and Hβ. Each emission line is fitted with a single Gaussian, with the only exception of Hβ, which shows signatures of a broad emission (see Supplementary Table 1). When trying to fit Hβ with one single Gaussian component, the resulting σHβ is greater than σ[O III]λ5008 by more than 7%, which is the expected difference due to the poorer spectral resolution at λHβ. Even though Fe emission can affect the Hβ region, we did not consider Fe features impactful for our analysis for two main reasons: (1) low-luminosity AGNs, including LRD AGNs, do not show evidences of FeII bump or Fe enhancement neither individually nor in stack97, while they are seen in QSOs possibly metal rich, which is definitely not the case of our target; (2) the low spectral resolution of the prism prevents us to disentangle the possible Fe feature from both the broad and narrow Hβ components. Thus, the Hβ emission line is modeled with two Gaussians accounting for both the narrow and broad components.

For the UV part of the spectrum, we have 8 free parameters in total (i.e., peak flux, peak wavelength, and FWHM for N iv and same for C iv, power-law exponent and normalization for their underlying continuum), while for the optical part we have 24 free parameters: i.e., peak flux, peak wavelength, and FWHM for [Ne III]λ3869, [O II], Hδ, Hγ, Hβnarrow, [O III]λ5007; peak flux and FWHM for Hβbroad; peak flux and wavelength for [O III]λ4364, given that we fixed FWHM[O III]λ4364 = FWHM[O III]5008; power-law exponent and normalization for their underlying continuum. We explore the parameter space for each part of the spectrum using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm implemented in the EMCEE package98, assuming uniform priors for the fitting parameters, considering 5 walkers per parameter and 2000 trials (the typical burn-in phase is about 200 trials). Priors on the FWHM are tight, depending on the resolution of the prism, with the exception of the FWHMbroadHβ. More precisely, the prior on the FWHM of the narrow component of every fitted emission line is set to be \({{{{\rm{FWHM}}}}}_{{{{\rm{narrowline}}}}}^{{{{\rm{prior}}}}}\in [1,2]\) spectral resolution elements. The size of the spectral resolution element at the peak wavelength of each fitted line is derived considering the well-known variation of the prism resolution with wavelength99.

We compute the integrated fluxes by integrating the best-fitting functions for each emission line. In Supplementary Table 1, we report the fluxes and widths of the fitted emission lines. Unless otherwise stated, we report the median value of the posterior, and 1σ error bars are the 16th and 84th percentiles. Upper or lower limits are given at 3σ.

Given the resolution of the prism, Hγ is blended with [O III]λ4364; nonetheless, a clear peak at the nominal [O III]λ4364 wavelength is observed (see Supplementary Fig. 2). Therefore, we fitted the blend using two Gaussian components and the results are shown in the Supplementary Table 1 (see Fiducial). Since we detected significant broad Hβ emission, a broad Hγ component could be present along with the narrow Hγ and [O III]λ4364 emission lines. We try to evaluate its impact on our results, considering the detection of the broad Hβ emission. Hence, we re-fitted the spectrum, adding an additional Gaussian component to the Hγ-[O III]λ4364 blend with FWHMHγ = FWHMHβ, \({\lambda }_{{{{\rm{H}}}}{\gamma }_{{{{\rm{broad}}}}}}^{{{{\rm{peak}}}}}={\lambda }_{{{{\rm{H}}}}{\gamma }_{{{{\rm{narrow}}}}}}^{{{{\rm{peak}}}}}\) and the \({F}_{{{{\rm{H}}}}{\gamma }_{{{{\rm{broad}}}}}}^{{{{\rm{peak}}}}}/{F}_{{{{\rm{H}}}}{\beta }_{{{{\rm{broad}}}}}}^{{{{\rm{peak}}}}}\) ratio corresponding to Case B recombination (see Test 1 in Supplementary Table 1). Alternatively, we also fitted the broad Hγ component considering \({F}_{{{{\rm{H}}}}{\gamma }_{{{{\rm{narrow}}}}}}^{{{{\rm{peak}}}}}/{F}_{{{{\rm{H}}}}{\gamma }_{{{{\rm{broad}}}}}}^{{{{\rm{peak}}}}}={F}_{{{{\rm{H}}}}{\beta }_{{{{\rm{narrow}}}}}}^{{{{\rm{peak}}}}}/{F}_{{{{\rm{H}}}}{\beta }_{{{{\rm{broad}}}}}}^{{{{\rm{peak}}}}}\) (see Test 2 in Supplementary Table 1). The spectral resolution and sensitivity of our data do not allow us to be conclusive regarding the presence of a broad Hγ component, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 2. Even though the broad Hγ over-predicts the data at λrest ~ 4300 Å, this is within 1 − 2σ, leading to good residuals. Based on the reduced χ2 criteria, the preferred solution is the one without the broad Hγ component (Fiducial), however the other two tests give still reasonably good fits. Therefore, hereafter, we will present primarily the results of our Fiducial fit, and we will discuss the uncertainties introduced by the possible broad Hγ component using the results from Tests 1 and 2.

In order to estimate the electron temperature, Te, and the gas-phase metallicity (hereafter metallicity), O/H, line fluxes need to be corrected for dust reddening. We derive the nebular reddening, E(B−V)neb, using the observed ratio of H Balmer lines, Hβ and Hγ, assuming the Calzetti attenuation law100. Indeed, the attenuation curve of high-z galaxies is found to be consistent with the Calzetti law. Regarding the observed Hγ/Hβ ratio, we consider the three cases described in the previous section, depending on whether and how a broad Hγ component is included. To derive the reddening, we could have also used Hδ but, given the low S/N of this line (lower than for Hγ), we cannot evaluate the possible uncertainties introduced by the presence of a broad component. The intrinsic Balmer ratios are computed using pyneb101 assuming Te = 104 K, and ne = 103 cm−3; results remain in agreement within error bars even if considering Te = 2 × 104 K, and ne = 104 cm−3. The derived nebular reddening and dust attenuation are reported in Supplementary Table 2. We note that the negative value found for our Fiducial model suggests the presence of a broad Hγ component, which adjusts the dust attenuation to a more reasonable value (see also Section “Spectral energy distribution fitting for a comparison with the stellar AV from SED fitting”). Emission line ratios are then computed using the reddening-corrected fluxes (see Supplementary Table 2). By definition, due to the proximity of the involved lines, [O III]λ5008/Hβ, [Ne III]λ3869/[O II]3727, and C iv/N iv] show almost no dependence on the reddening correction. These are the line ratios of interest for our study. [O II]3727/Hβ shows a variation of about 0.3 dex comparing the Fiducial with Test 1/2 models (when considering a broad Hγ component).

When measuring [Ne III]λ3869, we also account for the flux contributions from Hη, Hζ (λ = 3890.17 Å), and He Iλ3889, all of which are blended with [Ne III]λ3869 at the spectral resolution of the prism. We define the total blended flux as [NeIII]blend = [Ne III]λ3869 + Hζ + He Iλ3889 + Hη. To estimate the contamination from these additional lines, we proceed as follows. For Hζ and Hη, we compute the dust-corrected flux ratio Hδ/[NeIII]blend from the fiducial fit (see Supplementary Table 2), obtaining a value of \(0.6{3}_{-0.20}^{+0.28}\). Assuming the theoretical Balmer line ratios from Case B recombination with Te = 20,000 K and ne = 104 cm−3102, this implies that Hη/[Ne III]blend < 0.18 and Hζ/[Ne III]blend < 0.25. For He Iλ3889, it is not possible to estimate the contamination reliably because the He I λ5877 line, required for this calculation, is undetected in our data. Thus, we can only constrain the combined contribution of the Balmer lines, finding (Hζ + Hη)/[NeIII]blend < 0.43, which in turn implies [Ne III]λ3869/[NeIII]blend > 0.57. This represents an upper limit on the contamination, as the effect of He Iλ3889 is not included. Furthermore, using the dust-corrected fluxes derived from either Test 1 or Test 2 yields Hδ/[Ne III]blend = 0.50 ± 0.20 and 0.55 ± 0.20, corresponding to [Ne III]λ3869/[Ne III]blend > 0.66 and  >0.63, respectively. Given these uncertainties, we do not apply a contamination correction to [Ne III]λ3869. However, for the fiducial case, we report the magnitude of the estimated contamination in the relevant figures.

We detect the auroral [O III]λ4364 line, which can be used together with the [O III]λ5008 to derive the electron temperature and gas-phase metallicity103,104,105. Indeed, the electron temperature, Te([OIII]), of the high-ionization O2+ zone of the nebula is computed from the dust-corrected [O III]λ4364/[O III]λ5008 ratio (hereafter RO3). In each of the three cases discussed before, we find a high RO3, possibly indicating the presence of an AGN, a powerful ionizing source. Indeed, in Supplementary Fig. 3 we compare the observed value for RO3 with models from pyneb. For the fiducial dust-corrected RO3, \({T}_{e}([{{{\rm{O}}}}{{{\rm{III}}}}])=4.{0}_{-1.2}^{+1.6}\times 1{0}^{4}\) K, higher than the temperature usually found in normal star-forming galaxies (Te([OIII]) ~1−2 × 104 K)29,106. Even when considering the presence of the broad Hγ component, Te([OIII]) is high within the uncertainty, at least  >2 × 104 K. Evidently from Supplementary Fig. 3, our result is insensitive to the electron density within a range of ne = 102−104 cm−3. Using the models of ref. 107, we obtain a consistent result, having \({T}_{e}([{{{\rm{O}}}}{{{\rm{III}}}}])=3.{9}_{-1.0}^{+1.6}\times 1{0}^{4}\) K. Other extreme RO3 have been found in other galaxies at same redshift1,108,109, at z ~ 4110, and are also found in low-z Seyfert galaxies31,111,112. Moreover, such a high ratio of [O III]λ4364/Hγ as ours (\(\log ([{{{\rm{O}}}}\,{{{\rm{III}}}}]\lambda 4364/{{{\rm{H}}}}\gamma ) \sim -0.3\)) is observed in AGN113,114. This can be further seen by comparing nearby AGN and star-forming galaxies from SDSS115,116 in the[O III]λ4364/Hγ versus [O III]λ5008/[O III]λ4364 line ratio diagram, as done in ref. 21 for ZS7. In this diagram, local star-forming galaxies and AGN separate into two parallel sequences, with AGN occupying a region of higher electron temperatures and having elevated ratios of [O III]λ4364/Hγ. Indeed, our target lies at the extreme end of the AGN population, the farthest from the star-forming galaxies.

We aim to derive a first-order estimate of the metallicity of our source from the total oxygen abundance O/H = O2+/H+ + O+/H+. To compute O+/H+, Te([OII]) is required. However, none of the [O II] transitions ([O II]3727, [O II]λλ7322,7332) is or can be detected in the spectra. Therefore, we use the relation of ref. 117:

where Te is the electron temperature of the species in parentheses. For our fiducial case, Te([O II]) = 3.1 × 104 K. Ionic and total oxygen abundances are computed using pyneb, assuming that all O is in either the O2+ or O+ states inside HII regions. Indeed, O3+ may be neglected considering that it is  <5% of the total O even in very high-ionization systems118,119 and it is negligible given the uncertainty of our computations. The O2+/H+ ratio is derived from the dust-corrected [O III]5008/Hβ, the O+/H+ ratio from the dust-corrected [O II]3727/Hβ upper limit, and we assume the Te([OIII]), Te([O II]) derived above for the fiducial case. Given that the upper limit on [O II]3727/Hβ ratio and that the highest allowed electron temperature in Pyneb models is Te = 3 × 104 K, we can derive an upper limit on the metallicity. Indeed, O/H ratios decrease at fixed line ratios and increasing electron temperature. The inferred metallicity of our source is \(12+\log ({{{\rm{O}}}}/{{{\rm{H}}}}) < 7.9\) or \(\log (Z/{Z}_{\odot }) < -0.7\). The upper limit becomes more stringent if considering the presence of the broad Hγ component (either Test 1 or 2), having \(12+\log ({{{\rm{O}}}}/{{{\rm{H}}}}) < 6.9\) or \(\log (Z/{Z}_{\odot }) < -1.8\). As a word of caution, we mention that the possible presence of very high-density regions (\(\log ({n}_{e}) > > 4\)) have an impact on the observed flux of the [O III]λ5008 line due to the collisional de-excitation of the lower level [O III]λ5008 bearing transition38,45. However, the available data prevent us from quantifying this effect since the density distribution cannot be derived.

Additional evidence that CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 is metal-poor comes from the comparison of its position on the “OHNO” diagnostic diagram, which relates the line ratios [O III]5008/Hβ and [Ne III]λ3869/[O II]3727, with photoionization models (see Fig. 2). This diagnostic has been widely used to distinguish between star-forming galaxies and AGN, both at low and high redshift39,40,41. In the left panel of Fig. 2, we compare our measurements with several reference samples: z ~ 0 SDSS AGNs (blue colormap with contours) and galaxies (pink colormap with contours)116,120; z ~ 2 MOSDEF galaxies and AGNs (black contours)121,122; three systems at z > 6, namely SMACS 06355, 10612, and 04590 (red diamonds;42, where the left-most diamond corresponds to SMACS 06355, the type-II AGN identified by ref. 114); the type-I AGN host GS 3073 at z = 5.55 (filled pink and hollow diamonds, the latter representing the [Ne III]λ3869 flux estimated under the Case B assumption modulated by the median dust attenuation;45); the type-I AGN host ZS7 at z = 7.15 (yellow cross and diamond, depending on whether the line fluxes are derived from the BLR location or from the [O III] centroid, respectively;21); and a stack of AGNs from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) in the range 4 < z < 11 (green diamond;123). In the right panel of Fig. 2, we overlay AGN photoionization models from ref. 11 at hydrogen densities of \(\log n[{{{{\rm{cm}}}}}^{-3}]=2.0\) (grayscale) and \(\log n[{{{{\rm{cm}}}}}^{-3}]=4.0\) (colored scale). The observed “OHNO” ratios for CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 indicate a low metallicity, pointing toward \(\log (Z/{Z}_{\odot }) < -1.0\). Moreover, our stringent lower limit on [Ne III]λ3869/[O II]3727 implies a highly ionized gas, corresponding to an ionization parameter of \(\log U \sim -1.5\), consistent with values reported for other AGN candidates at z > 81,41.

As an alternative approach, we also estimate the gas-phase metallicity directly from the fiducial dust-corrected [O III]5008/Hβ ratio using the empirical calibration presented in refs. 106,124,125, under the assumption that the narrow emission lines are dominated by star formation. This yields metallicities of \(12+\log ({{{\rm{O}}}}/H)=7.0{8}_{-0.12}^{+0.14}\) (Z−0.02Z⊙), \(12+\log ({{{\rm{O}}}}/H)=7.4{0}_{-0.11}^{+0.13}\) (Z−0.05Z⊙), and \(12+\log ({{{\rm{O}}}}/H)=7.2{8}_{-0.12}^{+0.15}\) (Z ~ 0.04Z⊙), respectively. These values are fully consistent with the results from the “OHNO” diagnostic, which indicate Z ≪ 0.1Z⊙.

High-ionization lines requiring photoionization energy  >50−60 eV, such as N iv], N V, and [Ne v] are signatures of the presence of an AGN. Even though C iv is also usually associated with the presence of a central AGN15,18, it is not an unambiguous tracer of an AGN in the absence of other signatures (e.g., N iv, broad emission), since it has also been detected in some low-mass low-Z galaxies at high-z. We have clear evidence of N iv] and C iv emission, while both N V and [Ne v] remain undetected, as well as [C III]. We note, however, that the resolution of the prism does not allow us to assess the presence of N V since it is blended with the Lyα and its damping wing. In many AGNs some of these emission lines are either very weak or undetected if the S/N is not high enough126,127,128. For instance, in the type 1.8 AGN GS-3073 at z = 5.5129,130,131, the N V is five times weaker than N iv], which would be totally undetected in our spectrum. Similarly, N V is undetected in GNz-1118 and in other type 1 quasars132, while N iv] is strong. As discussed in refs. 18,132, [Ne v]/[Ne III]λ3869 can be quite low in AGNs, down to 10−2−10−4. The simultaneous detection of both C iv and N iv] in galaxies at z ~ 7 has been attributed to ionization by dense clusters of massive stars formed during an intense burst of star formation14. This interpretation is supported by high observed specific star formation rates (sSFR > 300 − 1000 Gyr−1) and large Hβ equivalent widths (EW > 400–600 Å). However, for CANUCS-LRD-z8.6, this scenario is unlikely due to its very low inferred sSFR (sSFR < 10 Gyr−1; see Section “Spectral energy distribution fitting” and Figure 18 in ref. 14), indicating that sources other than massive stars are needed to account for its strong ionization.

Given the uncertainties on the dust correction given by the possible presence of a broad Hγ component and the absence of the [O III]λ1666 emission line in the UV, we will just discuss the C iv/N iv] ratio, which is reddening insensitive, leaving aside the discussion about the C/O or N/O ratios, which would be severely affected by the uncertainties in the dust correction. Assuming that all the nitrogen is in N3+, emitted in N iv], and all the carbon in C3+, emitted in C iv, we obtain a low C iv/N iv] ratio, having dust corrected \(\log ({{{\rm{CIV}}}}/{{{\rm{NIV}}}})=0.07\pm 0.3\). Assuming a temperature of 40,000 K as derived from the [O III]λ4364/[O III]λ5008 ratio and a density of ne = 103 cm−3, we infer a carbon-over-nitrogen abundance of log(C/N)\(=-0.75\begin{array}{c}+0.05\\ -0.04\end{array}\). Such low C/N abundance ratio is similar to what was reported for some nitrogen-enriched galaxies observed at high redshift133, and aligns with abundance patterns measured for dwarf stars in local globular clusters134, possibly suggesting that material-enriched through the CNO cycle has been effectively ejected via powerful stellar winds from the outermost layers of massive stars135,136,137.

Robust estimates of BH masses usually come from reverberation mapping studies, which unfortunately are not feasible at high-z. Therefore, the so-called single-epoch virial mass estimate of MBH is often used15,55, assuming that virial relations are still valid at high-z and considering the continuum or line luminosity and the FWHM of the broad emission lines. For this work, we use the empirically derived relation:

where the best-fit values for the scaling parameters α, β depend on the respective emission lines and/or monochromatic luminosity Lλ chosen. For instance, considering the Hβ line one has α = (4.4 ± 0.2) × 106, β = 0.64 ± 0.2 at Lλ = LHβ or, considering the continuum luminosity at rest-frame 5100 Å, L5100Å, it is found α = (4.7 ± 0.3) × 106, β = 0.63 ± 0.06 at Lλ = λL5100 Å10. The BH masses derived from these relations can be found in Supplementary Table 3. Alternatively, we also used the relations of138, finding a systematic rise in BH mass of about 0.15−0.2 dex. These relationships are calibrated to the most updated and robust mass determinations from reverberation mapping. The majority of reverberation mapping studies have been conducted using Hβ on low-redshift AGN139,140,141,142. For high-z sources, the MgII or C iv line is often utilized. However, this involves applying additional scaling from the Hβ line to formulate the virial mass based on other lines143. These relations have been used to measure BH masses for thousands of sources with an estimated uncertainty of about factor 2–3 (i.e. dex = 0.3–0.5144), when using either Hβ or MgII. Estimates based on the high ionization C iv line are even more uncertain (>0.5 dex), as this line shows large velocity offsets, implying significant non-virialized motions145,146. Moreover, there is mounting evidence that large C iv blueshifts (>2000 km s−1) are more common at z > 6 than at lower redshifts147,148,149. Since the prism resolution of our data does not allow us to distinguish between the narrow and broad C iv component, either from the BLR or from outflows, we do not use the detected C iv emission line to infer the MBH. We report our estimate for the BH mass of CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 from both Hβ and L5100 Å in Supplementary Table 3 for our fiducial fit.

From the BH mass measurements (MBH,Hβ, MBH,5100 Å), we calculate the Eddington luminosity:

We also compute the bolometric luminosity (Lbol) of the AGN using the continuum luminosity at 3000 Å and using the bolometric correction presented by ref. 150. From the LEdd and Lbol, we derive the corresponding Eddington ratios λEdd = Lbol/LEdd = 0.1. We report all our results in Supplementary Table 3. We find comparable quantities (within 0.2–0.5 dex) also for the Test 1 and Test 2 cases.

We perform a spectro-photometric fit to the NIRCam photometry and NIRSpec spectroscopy using Bagpipes43,44 with the primary goal of determining the stellar mass for CANUCS-LRD-z8.6. There was no need to scale the spectrum to the photometry. In the Bagpipes SED fitting procedure, we fix the redshift to the spectroscopic redshift of 8.63, and we assume a double power law (DPL) star formation history (SFH), Calzetti dust attenuation curve151, and Chabrier initial mass function (IMF)152. The priors for the fitting parameters are reported in Supplementary Table 4. We fixed the ionization parameter to \(\log (U)=-1.5\), which is derived from the ‘OHNO' diagnostic (see Section “Electron temperature and metallicity”). We also set the range of metallicity considering the highest upper limit derived from observations, Z < 0.2Z⊙ (see Section “Electron temperature and metallicity”). We checked that our results do not change when increasing the upper bound of the metallicity range up to Z = 2.5Z⊙.

We adopt a Calzetti attenuation curve in the SED fitting procedure as the dust attenuation curves of high-redshift galaxies (z > 6) are generally found to be flat and lack a prominent UV bump feature153,154. In addition to using the Calzetti standard template as our fiducial dust attenuation model, we try to fit the data with an SMC template. Moreover, we adopt a flexible analytical attenuation model153,154 to better constrain the shape of the dust attenuation curve for our object. The resulting inferred attenuation curve is Calzetti-like, though slightly shallower in the rest-frame UV. We also found that the assumed shape of the dust attenuati on curve significantly impacts the inferred V-band dust attenuation (ΔAV ~ 0.6 dex), which in turn affects fundamental galaxy properties to a lesser extent (e.g., M*, SFR, and stellar age by 0.2–0.4 dex) due to degeneracies. This is consistent with previous studies that conducted similar analysis121,153,155,156.

Alongside the DPL model, which we use as our fiducial SFH model, we also perform fits with other SFHs, including the nonparametric SFHs from ref. 88 and the Leja model with a continuity prior157, and the parametric exponentially declining SFH. We found similar results within uncertainties regardless of the SFH model choice. However, this may be an exception rather than the rule, as some studies in the literature indicate that SFH model selection can significantly impact the inferred galaxy properties153,156,157,158,159.

Firstly, we fitted the observed SED without including an AGN contribution (no-AGN run). Therefore, to allow reliable estimates of the inferred host galaxy's properties, we subtracted from the observed spectrum the broad Hβ component, which is a clear AGN signature, using the best-fitting model shown in Figure 1. We checked that subtracting the C iv and N iv] did not change the fitting results. We did not treat the UV continuum, since the real AGN contribution in LRDs to the UV flux is still unknown, and we wanted to understand what the properties of CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 would be if all the observed UV light came from stars. Supplementary Fig. 4 shows the Bagpipes spectro-photometric fit in orange along with the posterior distribution of some quantities of interest and the resulting SFH. Results for the fitting parameters are reported in Supplementary Table 4. The best-fitting Bagpipes model is able to reproduce most of the shape of the observed spectrum of CANUCS-LRD-z8.6. However, it does not capture some features that can be ascribed to the presence of a powerful ionizing source: (i) the non-detection of [O II]3727 emission while a very bright [O III]λ5008 emission; (ii) the full Hγ-[O III]λ4364 flux; (iii) the red slope of the continuum in the optical regime; (iv) the C iv and N iv] emissions. Indeed, in this run of Bagpipes, the main excitement mechanism for emission lines comes from stars thus, in our case, simple stellar population (SSP) models cannot reproduce all the observed spectral features.

Consequently, we run Bagpipes including a model for AGN continuum, and broad Hβ56 (AGN run). In Bagpipes, following ref. 160, the AGN continuum emission is modeled with a broken power law, with two spectral indices (αλ, βλ) and a break at λrest = 5100 Å. The broad Hβ is modeled as a Gaussian varying normalization and velocity dispersion. From this run we get \(\log ({M}_{*}/{M}_{\odot })=9.2\pm 0.1\), and a spectral index in the UV regime of αλ ~ −2. The continuum slope in the UV is usually found to be within the (−2, 2) range of values160,161,162,163 and even though αλ ~−2 gives a good result in terms of residuals (\({\chi }_{{{{\rm{red}}}}}^{2}=2.2\)), comparable to the no-AGN case, the posterior is hitting the edge of the prior lower limits. Therefore, we performed a run with Bagpipes extending the lower range of the prior on αλ down to  −4, in order to ascertain the implications on the derived properties. In this case, we get a \({\chi }_{{{{\rm{red}}}}}^{2}=2.0\), and the best fit αλ is equal to  −2.9 ± 0.1. The stellar mass show an increase to \(\log ({M}_{*}/{M}_{\odot })=9.65\pm 0.1\), while the other properties still remain consistent within errorbars with the run having αλ ~ −2. Supplementary Fig. 5 shows the Bagpipes spectro-photometric fit in orange along with the posterior distribution of some quantities of interest and the resulting SFH. The red continuum in the optical is captured by the best-fitting model, as well as the broad emissions. Furthermore, the [O II] emission is dimmer than in the previous run, yet it still does not align with the observed non-detection. The metallicity in both runs (w/o and with AGN) is in agreement with the observed data. The dust attenuation is about 2.2 times higher than in the previous run, causing the stellar mass to increase 0.4 dex. We did not set a tight prior on AV since the observed value is very uncertain (see Section 22 and Supplementary Table 2); indeed it is in agreement within errors with the results of both no-AGN and AGN runs, considering that \({A}_{V}=0.44{A}_{V}^{{{{\rm{neb}}}}}\) assuming a Calzetti dust law151. However, in order to compare with the results from the no-AGN run, we run Bagpipes including the AGN model as before and setting a tight Gaussian prior around the value of AV determined from the no-AGN run (AGN-tight run), and we obtained AV = 0.7 ± 0.2 and \(\log ({M}_{*}/{M}_{\odot })=9.42\pm 0.07\). Finally, the degeneracy between the AGN model, AV and M* is evident, and prevents us from obtaining a precise determination of M*. For the aim of this work, we considered the M* derived from the AGN-run as fiducial, and its error accounts for the uncertainties due to the variation of the SED model, i.e. \(\log ({M}_{*}/{M}_{\odot })=9.6{5}_{-0.44}^{+0.1}\) (corrected for magnification).

With these caveats, we propose a physical model to explain the observed properties of CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 (see also and Fig. 4 for details). Our modeling of CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 suggests an AGN-dominated UV continuum with minimal dust obscuration along our sight-line, while the red rest-optical continuum is likely due to dust-obscured stellar emission. Its compact size and high SFR (about 50−150 M⊙yr−1) indicate significant obscuration in stellar birth clouds. This suggests that CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 is in an evolved state that will transition toward a luminous quasar-like system at z = 6, rather than a lower-luminosity AGN at similar redshifts. Even though the run including the AGN component better reproduces the observed data, higher wavelength observations are needed to constrain the real AGN contribution to the observed multiwavelength light of CANUCS-LRD-z8.6. How best to incorporate AGN components in SED fitting for LRDs remains a topic of ongoing debate due to the inability of current data to meaningfully distinguish between different models4,47,164. In light of these uncertainties, we decided to use the stellar mass of the AGN-run and to account for the variation arising from the other models (no-AGN, AGN-tight) in the error bars.

In this section, we investigate the possible formation channels for the massive BH powering CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 by comparing the inferred BH mass with predictions from semi-analytical models (SAM) and numerical simulations.

To get a first approximate idea about the possible growth history of the CANUCS-LRD-z8.6's BH, we first assume that this BH has been accreting for its entire history at a fixed rate, expressed as a fraction of the Eddington rate, with a constant radiative efficiency ϵ = 0.1. As shown in Fig. 5, fixing the accretion rate to the observed value (λEdd = 0.1) requires an extremely heavy BH mass (Mseed > 3 × 107M⊙) at redshifts higher than 25. This seed mass is higher than any value predicted by theoretical models165. This implies that, at earlier epochs, the BH powering CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 must have been accreted at rates higher than the one observed at z = 8.63.

Assuming λEdd = 1 leads to a seed mass of Mseed ~ 104M⊙ at z~25 or Mseed ≳ 105M⊙ at z ~ 15. This growth path is consistent both with intermediate-mass BHs formed in dense star clusters166 and with heavy seeds predicted by the direct-collapse BH scenario60, and/or by scenarios based on primordial black holes167,168.

Assuming λEdd = 1.5, the required seed mass would be consistent with low-mass seeds (10-100 M⊙) from Pop III stellar remnants at z ≳ 20169. This argument suggests that the BH in CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 originates from heavy seeds, constantly growing at a pace close to Eddington, or from light seeds constantly growing at super-Eddington rates.

In the following, we discuss the formation channel of CANUCS-LRD-z8.6's BH more accurately by performing a comparison with SAM predictions. Initially, we consider the results by ref. 64, hereafter C24. This model, calibrated to match the galaxy stellar mass function in the local universe, is also able to reproduce the luminosity and stellar mass functions of galaxies up to z ~ 964, and the local MBH − M* relation. The C24 models are based on the GAEA SAM [e.g.,170,171] run on merger trees extracted by using the PINOCCHIO code172, and we consider here two different seeding models: (i) Pop III.1, a scheme that allows for an early formation of massive seeds (about 105M⊙) at z ~ 25 from the collapse of Pop III protostars173; this formation mechanism is physically motivated and does not depend on the mass resolution of the simulation; (ii) All Light Seed (ALS), a model that results into seeds of 10-100 M⊙. In this model, accretion onto BHs is assumed to be Eddington-Limited. Pop III.1 stars are a subclass of Population III stars, which ref. 174 divided into two categories. Pop III.1 stars are a unique type of Population III stars that form at the centers of dark matter minihalos in the early universe (z ≳ 20), remaining isolated from any stellar or BH feedback174. In contrast, Pop III.2 stars also form within dark matter minihalos but are affected by feedback from external astrophysical sources. This external influence promotes gas fragmentation, leading to the formation of lower-mass stars compared to Pop III.1.

For the scope of this work, we compare CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 with the most massive BHs predicted by the C24 models at z ~ 8 for the two seeding prescriptions, as shown in the left panel of Supplementary Fig. 6. This comparison implies that SAMs employing Eddington-limited accretion, although successfully describing the statistical properties of galaxies and BHs from the local up to the high-z universe, fail in reproducing the most extreme BHs at high-redshift, with CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 representing one of the most extreme examples.

We further consider the results by ref. 69, which investigates the formation of massive BHs at z > 7 by means of the SAM Cosmic Archaeology Tool (CAT)68. In this work, the seeding prescription accounts for both light and heavy seeds, and the BH growth can occur in the Eddington-limited (EL) and super-Eddington (SE) regimes. As can be seen from the left panel of Supplementary Fig. 6, in the CAT framework, the EL model predicts BH masses that are consistent with GNz-11 at z ~ 10 and CEERS-1019 at z ~ 8.741, but do not exceed about 107M⊙, therefore being inconsistent with our new data. The model including SE accretion predicts several tracks that successfully assemble 108M⊙ at z = 8.669, the most massive one shown in blue in the left panel of Fig. 5. Thus, super-Eddington accretion is essential to assemble a large amount of mass within 500 Myr (see also refs. 175,176) and therefore to reproduce the CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 inferred mass.

The main caveat of SAMs is that they cannot fully capture the complex and non-linear interplay between BH accretion and feedback processes. Therefore, the growth predicted in SAMs during the SE phase might be too efficient, if compared to more sophisticated models, e.g. hydrodynamical numerical simulations. This is clearly shown by the results of refs. 177,178 that are based on numerical simulations with light seeds growing at super-Eddington pace. From refs. 177,178 results, it can be seen that early light seeds, even if accreting at super-Eddington rate, can reach a maximum mass of 105M⊙ (107M⊙) at z ~ 6, thus being unable to reproduce the BH masses estimated so far at z > 6. For this reason, most of the numerical hydro-dynamical simulations of BH formation and growth assume a heavy seed prescription (Mseed > 105M⊙) to reproduce the large masses of BHs powering z ~ 6 quasars. The accretion rate onto the BHs is modeled according to the Bondi–Hoyle–Lyttleton prescription179,180,181, with a boost factor α used as a correction factor for the spatial resolution of the gas distribution surrounding the BH.

In what follows, we separately discuss predictions from simulations that cap the BH accretion to the Eddington limit and those that allow for super-Eddington growth. In the middle panel of Supplementary Fig. 6, we report the results of EL simulations. We find that the only simulation that can reproduce the CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 BH mass is the reference run by ref. 177. Vice-versa, both ref. 72, when using the numerical recipe of the FABLE suite71, and ref. 182 predict a BH mass that is about 1 order of magnitude smaller. Interestingly, all the simulations reported in this panel, though being inconsistent with CANUCS-LRD-z8.6, are capable of reproducing AGN candidates such as GNz-11 at z~10 and CEERS-1019 at z ~ 8.741, and the estimated masses of BHs powering z~6 quasars, apart from the most extreme case of J0100+2802 (MBH ~ 1010M⊙,15). We further notice that the simulations by177 predict a BH mass at z~8 that is about 2 orders of magnitude smaller with respect to the reference run, if a radiative efficiency larger than only a factor of two is considered. This clearly shows how sensitive predictions from numerical simulations are to the feedback prescriptions implemented.

We now move to numerical simulations of heavy BH seeds' growth, including super-Eddington accretion, shown in the right panel of Supplementary Fig. 6. First of all, we note that the reference run by ref. 72 is able to reproduce not only CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 but also z ~ 6 quasars, including the extreme case of J0100+2802. With respect to the original recipe employed in the FABLE suite (shown in the middle panel), in the reference run the authors apply the following variations: (i) reduce the halo mass where BH seeds are placed (from Mh = 5 × 1010h−1 M⊙ to Mh = × 109h−1 M⊙), effectively resulting in earlier BH seeding (from z ~ 13 to z ~ 18); (ii) reduce the overall AGN feedback; (iii) allow for mild super-Eddington accretion (λEdd = 2). All these changes promote early BH growth, which emerges as a necessary condition to explain the BH mass of early AGN and quasars. Interestingly, this simulation supports a scenario in which CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 represents a progenitor of the most massive QSOs at z > 6, such as J0100+2802.

We further notice that the run Bh22d of ref. 182 (see also the similar setup used in ref. 183) predicts a rapid mass assembly consistent with CANUCS-LRD-z8.6, if the accretion rate is boosted (λEdd = 2, α = 100) and the radiative efficiency is low (ϵ = 0.1), which in turn lowers the AGN feedback effect on the BH growth. Similarly, refs. 177,184 find the AGN feedback to be the most limiting factor in BH growth.

Notably, in ref. 177, the BH grows less in the super-Eddington regime due to the excessive feedback. However, this conclusion is sensitive to the detailed numerical implementation. Reference 185 explored the BH growth with high-resolution numerical simulations with a comprehensive model of AGN feedback in the super-Eddington regime. They find that the jet power in the super-Eddington regime is a critical factor in regulating the accretion rate onto the BH, because of its ability to remove the fueling gas, as also found in other works186. Their run with low feedback predicts a BH mass at z ~ 8.5, only a factor of about 2 smaller than CANUCS-LRD-z8.6.

We further compare model predictions with the stellar mass inferred for CANUCS. The CAT model, including SE accretion, predicts systems with black holes over-massive with respect to their host galaxy when compared to the local MBH–M* relation70. This is a consequence of a de-coupled evolution between the BH and the galaxy, triggered after short (0.5–3 Myr), (1–4%) phases of SE accretion during which the BH experiences fast growth and suppresses star formation via efficient feedback, a scenario that is also supported by recent simulations52 and observations of quiescent over-massive black holes53. Interestingly, the stellar masses predicted by CAT at z ~ 9 are consistent with the low-mass end of the estimated stellar mass for CANUCS-LRD-z8.6. Regarding numerical simulations, the reference model in ref. 177 also successfully assembles  >1010M⊙ by z ~ 9, satisfying the constraints posed by CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 both in terms of black hole mass and stellar mass assembly at z = 8.6. To our knowledge, none of the other models explored in this overview are able to satisfy both constraints, although for many of them we were not able to recover the information on the stellar mass from their published works.

The comparison among results from different numerical simulations emphasizes how complex is the modeling of BH seeding, accretion rate, and AGN feedback, and how important it is to collect observational data as the one provided in this work. CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 poses significant challenges to both hydrodynamical simulations and semi-analytical models. Its existence requires rapid and efficient assembling of 108M⊙ in only 500 Myr, thus providing stringent constraints to seeding prescriptions, feedback recipes, and accretion physics modeling in theoretical models and simulations.

Memo may not be the world's fastest barista, but it is impressive—for a robot.

I recently watched as Memo, a new home robot from a company called Sunday Robotics, made coffee in an open-plan kitchen in Mountain View, California.

Memo looks like something out of Wall-E, with a gleaming white body, two arms, a friendly cartoonish face, and a red baseball cap. Rather than using legs as a fully humanoid robot would, Memo moves around using a wheeled platform and changes its height by sliding up and down a central column atop that platform.

The robot responded to a request for an espresso by rolling over to a countertop, and then using two pincerlike hands to slowly go through each step required to operate an espresso machine. It filled the porta filter with coffee grounds, tamped them down, slotted the porta filter into place and put a coffee cup below, pressed the buttons needed to start the machine, and finally retrieved the hot drink.

“We want to build robots that free people from laundry, from the dishes, from all chores,” Tony Zhao, cofounder and CEO of Sunday Robotics, told me as the robot brought the coffee over to the person who requested it.

Making a cup of espresso might not seem spectacular, but the feat is ridiculously hard for a robot to do in a real, messy kitchen. It requires the ability to identify different objects, figure out how to grasp them reliably, and use those objects properly. Sunday is not only building its own hardware but also training the models that allow its system to learn. “We think the way to make a home robot is to be full-stack, and to vertically integrate,” Zhao says. “And that's a very ambitious thing to do.”

Today most robots still do precise, repetitive work in tightly controlled environments; for example, moving the same item from one position to another over and over again. Unlike humans, industrial robots cannot typically adapt or improvise to changes or unfamiliar situations. The last decade has seen some companies build robots that use AI to do simple things, like identify objects on a conveyor belt and decide how to grasp them. This is, however, far less complex than operating in an environment as varied and messy as a real home.

Of course, robot demos are not always a good indicator of how useful a robot will be. The real question is how well Memo can perform tasks in a wide variety of homes without Sunday's engineers nearby.

Even so, the robot has some skills. Besides making coffee, I watched Memo clear glasses from a table and load them into a dishwasher. This feat was especially impressive because it involved figuring out how to grasp two glasses in the same hand. Memo held one glass between its thumb and pointer finger, and used the rest of its hand to grab the second.

This kind of dexterity relies on Sunday's key innovation: a novel way of training robots that delivers more humanlike dexterity. Sunday pays remote workers to use gloves resembling Memo's hands to do household chores. Zhao says the gloves, which cost roughly $400 a pair, provide a more accurate training signal than teleoperation, which is the standard way for a person to control a robot. The training data gathered from glove-wearing workers is fed into an AI model that takes input from the robot's sensors and controls its motions.

“This is a very exciting variant on home robots,” says Ken Goldberg, a roboticist at UC Berkeley and the cofounder of Ambi Robotics. “It's a beautiful design, and a much smarter kind of data capture.”

The fact that any company thinks it can build a useful and functional home robot is a sign of skyrocketing optimism about progress in robotics—and not without reason. Researchers have shown in the last few years that robots can tap into the capabilities of large language models, the brains behind today's chatbots, and use them to respond to commands or make sense of a scene.

Some researchers hope that gathering large amounts of data that shows how to perform different actions—picking up cups, folding shirts, and so on—will produce a more general kind of robotic intelligence.

Zhao and Sunday's other cofounder and CTO, Cheng Chi, have both contributed advances that have kindled hope of robotic breakthroughs. Zhao worked on a project called Mobile ALOHA at Stanford University that involved training robots using a low-cost mobile teleoperation system. Chi worked on a project from Stanford, Columbia University, and the Toyota Research Institute, that showed how a cheap clawlike device could be used to gather data from humans doing tasks like cleaning dishes.

“If you think about the most powerful AIs, ChatGPT or image-generation models,” Zhao says, “they are trained on the whole internet. We just don't have the internet for robotics.”

A handful of other startups are currently hustling to develop and deploy more capable robots, including systems designed to work in ordinary homes. Physical Intelligence, Skild, and Generalist are all working on robot models that can adapt to new situations using this approach. 1x recently revealed a humanoid home robot, though this system still requires teleoperation to perform some tasks.

Sarah Guo, founder and managing partner of Conviction, says that Sunday, which includes veterans from Tesla and Google DeepMind, is well placed to build both hardware and models. “Tony and Cheng are incredibly good,” she says. “They've since recruited and enabled an all-star team that can uniquely do hardware–AI co-design, and deliver a full-stack product.”

Eric Vishria, a general partner at venture capital firm Benchmark, which is backing Sunday, said in a statement that the startup's practical approach is the way to make robots more useful. “The promise of AI robotics isn't doing a backflip or dancing demos, but robots that work in messy, real-world situations,” Vishria said, adding that Sunday's “breakthroughs mark the start of an exponential curve toward a future where robots actually work in our day-to-day lives.”

Sunday plans to give Memo to beta testers next year. The pilot program will show how people respond to having a home robot that can do certain chores—albeit slowly, and perhaps not perfectly every time. A key question will be how reliably and efficiently Memo is able to do chores in real homes where kids, pets, and mess are guaranteed to complicate the challenge.

After beta testing, Zhao says Sunday will roll Memo out to the first users. Just as early home computers were complicated and appealed mostly to enthusiasts, he believes Memo might initially be popular with those who want to live in a robotic future and are willing to tolerate some rough edges. This might even involve users showing their robots how to do something new. “I do think that people should be able to teach their own robots,” Zhao says.

Perhaps the era of truly capable home robots is almost upon us. For now though, I'd settle for a decent espresso.

China has your back if you ever need to repair an expensive Nvidia GPU.

Nvidia's modular PCIe connector on the GeForce RTX 5090, one of the best graphics cards, and the RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell may not be difficult to procure if you know where to look. The connector is readily available on Chinese second-hand e-commerce marketplaces, such as Goofish, for less than $25. This information is helpful in case you accidentally damage the connector and need a replacement.

If you have not been keeping up with the latest Nvidia gossip, there have been two incidents of damage to the modular PCIe connector in the past few weeks. One incident resulted from a failed liquid-cooling attempt on the expensive GeForce RTX 5090, while the other was caused by improper packaging during transportation, affecting an even more eye-watering RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell. Although both damages were attributed to user error, the outcome was favorable, as Nvidia unexpectedly agreed to provide replacements in both instances.

Uniko's Hardware (click the tweet below to expand it) has identified that numerous Chinese vendors are selling the Nvidia PCIe connector on Xianyu, the domestic platform counterpart of Goofish. The connectors are priced at approximately $19 to $23, with some sellers offering free shipping. That's the price before tariffs, though. It is important to note that these are salvaged components; therefore, they are unlikely to include warranties. Nonetheless, a $23 gamble may be justified, given that one has spent over $1,999 on a graphics card.

finally dug it outyes ppl on xianyu are selling the pcie part of the nvidia rtx50.its around ~24usd.btw, nvidia making the rtx50 fe "modular" is not for easy repair, but for max cooling performance, the socalled double flow through. https://t.co/oQ0psCmB5P pic.twitter.com/5ghGW54gEmNovember 19, 2025

Nvidia was generous in resolving both situations, despite the apparent cause being user error. The chipmaker could have easily declined to provide replacements, as user error is outside the scope of standard warranty coverage. One cannot help but ponder whether there exists an ulterior motive behind Nvidia's actions.

NorthridgeFix, a renowned electronics repair establishment with a subscriber base exceeding 400,000, showcased both cases on its YouTube platform. The RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell, featuring a damaged PCIe connector, was allegedly the property of a high-profile tech YouTuber boasting over 40 million subscribers. One might contend that Nvidia just wanted to avoid negative publicity. It also makes you wonder whether an average Joe would receive the same level of treatment.

Nvidia is the world's first company to reach a valuation of $5 trillion; therefore, replacing a graphics card costing $1,999 or even $10,000 will not even dent its financials. Moreover, the graphics card merely requires a replacement of the PCIe connector, which Nvidia can easily replace and subsequently sell. The issue is that Nvidia doesn't sell individual replacement parts, so you or a third party can't do the replacement. Nonetheless, if you find yourself in a predicament involving a damaged PCIe connector and Nvidia does not provide a favorable resolution, you know where to look.

AI won't replace real estate agents completely. But it will accelerate how they do their work. 

That's part of the bet behind Seattle startup Desk, which has raised $800,000 to help real estate agents offload contract administration to AI.

The company's lead investor is Martin Tobias of Incisive Ventures. PSL's Geoff Entress and Flyhomes CEO Tushar Garg also invested.

Desk acts as an AI transaction coordinator, taking over administrative tasks such as tracking contract deadlines, drafting paperwork, and prepping signing packets. CEO and co-founder Gideon Sylvan said the tool combines “encyclopedic knowledge” of contracts with the tacit know-how of active local agents.

“Every agent wants to avoid paperwork, but most agents would rather do the work themselves than wait three hours for their assistant to handle it,” Sylvan said.

More than 500 agents in the Seattle area are using the software, including two board members of Northwest Multiple Listing Service. Desk said it is processing 100+ closed transactions per month, with inaccuracies on fewer than 0.2% of deals.

Desk, founded earlier this year, is also targeting brokerages to help them maintain transaction records. 

Sylvan said the February release of Claude 3.7 was a breakthrough, transforming how accurately AI can read and interpret real estate contracts — including edge cases like handwritten signatures and custom conditions. “Suddenly complex contract assistance went from ‘this will be possible one day' to ‘this is truly better-than-human,'” he noted.

While some companies are trying to replace real estate agents, Sylvan said that it's more likely that AI becomes the “execution layer.”

“Being an agent is a contact sport filled with 10-second phone calls and short texts,” he said. “Deals come together when two agents trust each other. But the paperwork? I could care less if an AI put the paperwork together. That's just inevitable.”

Sylvan and co-founder Stewart Renehan previously launched Lotside, a startup billed as “Zillow for house flippers.” That company didn't quite take off but still has 20,000 monthly users, Sylvan said. 

Sylvan also built a U.S. brokerage, while Renehan led data science at a PushSpring, a marketing tech startup acquired by T-Mobile in 2019.



University of Washington scientists and students are using AI to create real medicines.

Better treatments for cancer, autoimmune diseases, viruses and more are now on the horizon thanks to groundbreaking work with artificial intelligence from a team of scientists at the University of Washington's Institute for Protein Design. Led by Nobel Prize winner David Baker, this team of Huskies uses AI tools to create proteins — biology's building blocks — that lay the foundation for new medicines. Together, this international group of students, faculty and researchers acts as a “communal brain,” with each Husky contributing ideas and expertise from their fields. The institute's recent breakthroughs — including an antivenom for snakebites, and antibiotics that combat drug-resistant bacteria — show how this innovative science can save and change lives.

In my view, they (the govt) either should have not gave permission on selling the devices who relies on having a 3G network for emergency calls for at least 10 years ago, or they should just have their 3G network operable for another 5 years.For example, our country (South Korea) had 2G networks operable until ~2021, and are planning to have all of the 3G networks operable for the foreseeable future. It can be done.

It's fun to imagine a world where a lie like this could be a legal liability. I mean an actual court case, where evidence is brought and the claim is tested. "Is customer safety a higher priority than shareholder value?" and "why don't you support old devices" and then Samsung would need to produce internal evidence to try to make their case.Nothing like that will ever happen, but I can dream.

Which can be less of a problem if there are full-digit emergency numbers that could be saved as a contact (preferably quick-dial).Auto-call routing can fail if you're on one side of a regional border but are connected to a cell on the other - and local EMS can't forward calls to the neighboring EMS (or just suck at it).I used to live on a border and local EMS was 3-digit only. The only way to call the correct EMS was to call their non-emergency number and get forwarded - but only after getting scolded first for not calling the 3-digit number.

I think there's a lot more code running on SIM cards these days to reduce/prevent that. On my Canadian Rogers phone, when I do a network scan, I don't see the american networks at all, but then when I put in a foreign SIM, they light up. Similarly, it can take a while of driving into the US before it detaches from the Canadian network and finally hands over to the US.It was actually an issue with my French SIM that was supposed to work in Canada and USA: it REALLY wanted to connect to the US networks, even though I was ~10 stories up in Toronto and very occasionally getting an SMS through once an hour to the US network.

Isn't it black screen of death now?

Blue screens of death in public are an increasingly rare yet ever-so-hilarious phenomenon. Back in the day, a blue screen remaining up for hours on end, like the infamous giant LED wall at the Beijing Olympics rehearsal, often reminded us that we're not so different after all. Now, Microsoft is tightening its rope on even these unorthodox BSOD appearances with a new "Digital Signage Mode" announced at the Ignite 2025 event.

As the name suggests, this is a special mode that can be configured inside Windows 11, part of the recovery settings found in the OS. Once enabled, any blue screen of death will only remain visible for 15 seconds, then automatically disappear without needing manual intervention. Keep in mind that a BSOD almost always leads to an immediate restart anyway, so these are edge-case scenarios we're talking about.

If the computers running the signage aren't properly set up to deal with a sudden crash, or if an IT team isn't actively present at the site monitoring them, that's when this mode can come in clutch. "Once enabled, it helps ensure no Windows screens or error dialogs will show on your public displays," said Microsoft in the announcement blog, which also details AI agents that we recently covered in our Agent Workspace story.

 




Digital signage mode is not related to the already existing Kiosk mode, which locks down Windows to just one platform or application, often booting directly into it without loading other UI. Kiosks run enterprise-grade Windows, which is more stable to begin with, but a lot of the time, billboards and posters are managed more leniently, where such a fallback could be of genuine help in an emergency.

Once again, we're only referring to non-interactive screens showing adverts here, so that lousy government software-running terminal in your local office won't be affected. Microsoft says in its blog post that Kiosk mode is still the ideal choice for interactive displays, such as those issuing tickets at a bank, or perhaps an ordering counter at a restaurant.

Aside from this new recovery feature set to rob us of iconic public BSODs, Microsoft also introduced other stability-based improvements in Windows, such as a more comprehensive restore point system, called "Point-in-time Restore." IT managers will now be able to use the Intune portal to service PCs even more thoroughly, with remote access to the OOBE setup. Copilot made an expected appearance at the event as well, with lots of focus on AI features we all definitely asked for.

Google Maps is rolling out new features designed to help users save time and feel more prepared, including a Gemini-powered “know before you go” tool. The navigation app is also launching an improved Explore tab and a new EV charger availability prediction feature.

Now, when users search for places in Maps like restaurants, hotels, or concert venues, they'll see a new “know before you go” tips section that will surface important information about the place. For instance, it might tell users the best way to book a reservation, what secret menu items are, what the best place to park is, and more. Users can click on each tip to get more information.

This “know before you go” tips section is rolling out now in the U.S. on Android and iOS.

As for the updated Explore tab, Google has made it easier and faster to find trending spots near you. Users can now swipe up to see trending and popular restaurants, activities, and sights nearby, such as a new cafe that just opened up or a quirky art gallery around the corner.

The tech giant says it's now also easier to find curated lists from sources like Viator, Lonely Planet, and OpenTable, in addition to local influencers.

The updated Explore tab starts rolling out this month globally on Android and iOS.

Additionally, the company announced that EV drivers can now see how many chargers will likely be available once they arrive at their destination by searching for “EV chargers” in Maps. Google is using AI to analyze historical and real-time charger availability to predict how many chargers are likely to be free upon arrival. 

EV charger availability predictions start rolling out next week on Android Auto and cars with Google built-in.

Google is also making it possible for users to leave reviews under a nickname, such as “Eager Elf” or “Julia Loves Sweets.” Reviews are still associated with a Google Account behind the scenes, so users can only leave one review per business. This prevents them from swapping out nicknames to leave the business a series of bad reviews — a practice known as review bombing.  

Wednesday's announcement follows Google Maps' recent integration of Gemini, which lets users ask about points of interest along their route, get answers on topics like sports or news, and perform tasks such as adding events to their calendar.

Editor's note: This series profiles six of the Seattle region's “Uncommon Thinkers”: inventors, scientists, technologists and entrepreneurs transforming industries and driving positive change in the world. They will be recognized Dec. 11 at the GeekWire Gala. Uncommon Thinkers is presented in partnership with Greater Seattle Partners.

After earning his bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering, Brian Pinkard spent six months “flipping rocks,” as he describes it, in Colorado's Rocky Mountains.

The rock-flipping was purposeful work: Pinkard was clearing obstructions and building trails for AmeriCorps, spending every night in a tent.

“I loved it. It was great. And the reason I did that is because I wanted to do something that mattered, that made a difference in the world,” he said. When the program ended, he was inspired to direct his impact to a larger environmental challenge.

His passion to do good, paired with an engineer's drive for problem solving, led him to a doctoral degree from the University of Washington and then to launching Aquagga, a startup that's destroying PFAS — a toxic class of pollutants known as “forever chemicals.”

“Brian has been very laser focused on his mission,” said Igor Novosselov, Pinkard's PhD advisor and research professor at the UW's Department of Mechanical Engineering. “He's not a typical scientist who would just go and write a bunch of papers. He's going after impact where it matters.”

But a few steps before PFAS, Pinkard was focused on nerve gas in the Middle East.

When Pinkard joined Novosselov's lab, it had U.S. Department of Defense funding to develop an in-the-field, mobile strategy for treating barrels of abandoned chemical weapons in the Syrian desert. The previous solution was to truck the barrels to the Mediterranean Sea, load them on a boat and incinerate the material.

“If you're the guy who's got to transport a nerve agent,” Pinkard noted, “it's not a very good job.”

Within five years, the lab came up with a workable solution, but the need was no longer urgent and DoD shelved its application of the technology, though Novosselov continued to work on it.

Pinkard appreciated the tremendous power of the strategy for treating dangerous materials and wondered if there was another use case. Then as he was preparing to finish his PhD in June 2020, the COVID pandemic hit, derailing his plans to apply for a university postdoctoral fellowship as no one was hiring.

So he made a pivot to entrepreneurship — a role he had never considered. 

Pinkard teamed up with engineer and tech innovator Nigel Sharp to explore the potential for using the tech, called supercritical water oxidation, to treat sewage sludge from wastewater treatment plants, but they realized the market wasn't viable.

There was, however, buzz about PFAS.

“Everybody was talking about PFAS,” he said, and if anyone could figure out how to destroy the chemicals, it would be a breakthrough. That realization became his lightbulb moment.

PFAS is a family of chemicals that for decades have been added to firefighting foams, food packaging, carpets and fabrics, water-repellent clothing and non-stick pans. The resilient chemicals are great at deflecting water, stains and grease — but they escape from products and now contaminate drinking water across the nation and are even in mothers' breast milk.

PFAS are still in use, while researchers and regulators are increasingly concerned by their serious health impacts.

Pinkard and Sharp launched Aquagga in 2019 in Tacoma, Wash., and were soon joined by co-founder Chris Woodruff. The team kept the idea of modular treatment units but shifted to a related but different chemistry (hydrothermal alkaline treatment) for destroying PFAS, securing a patent for the approach from the Colorado School of Mines.

“Brian has been a great partner from the beginning,” said Timothy Strathmann, a Colorado School of Mines professor. “Unlike many entrepreneurs I've interacted with, he is also deeply interested in understanding the limitations and technical challenges associated with the technology. He's keenly aware that the long-term success of Aquagga will only be achieved by addressing the critical barriers to deployment.”

Aquagga's devices annihilates PFAS under super hot, high pressure conditions made caustic and corrosive through the addition of lye.

The company has done nine field demonstrations of its technology, including a project at an airport in Alaska, a DoD-funded project in North Carolina involving firefighting foams, and a wastewater demo with the City of Tacoma. It's now close to signing its first long-term commercial deployment, Pinkard said, “which will be a huge milestone for us.”

“It's really cool to see how much PFAS we've destroyed … even in our short journey,” Pinkard said. “And to think about where it could go, what it could enable at scale. So [I'm] very optimistic about Aquagga's future. I'm very optimistic about the impact we could create, the lives we could save.”

A group of Seattle nonprofits aiming to boost exposure to and participation in the arts among young people will receive nearly $7 million in funding from Allen Family Philanthropies.

The organizations — all leading projects on the Seattle Center campus — include independent radio station KEXP, the Museum of Pop Culture, Pacific Science Center and others.

Allen Family Philanthropies (formerly known as the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation) is a charitable entity started by the late Microsoft co-founder and his sister, Jody Allen, in 1988. The philanthropy invests in a number of areas, including arts and culture, science and technology, and research in all areas of bioscience.

The grants are aimed at projects intended to grow opportunities for diverse creators, increase access to arts programming and engagement, and reimagine spaces, according to a news release Wednesday.

Here are the eight nonprofits and their plans for how grants totaling $6,868,990 over three years will be used:

Seattle Center draws more than 12 million visitors annually, and is the most visited arts and cultural destination in the Pacific Northwest.

“By investing in arts organizations that engage young people, we invest in the creators, audiences, and advocates who will contribute to and sustain a vibrant arts and culture sector in Seattle for years to come,” said Anh Nguyen, director of arts, youth and community for Allen Family Philanthropies. “These organizations excel at engaging young artists and young audiences — and know how to ignite curiosity. The grants will ensure youth arts and culture programming can continue to grow and evolve to meet community needs.”

Allen Family Philanthropies' funding for Seattle Center organizations follows previous arts investments from the foundation, including $9 million to eight downtown arts organizations to support nearly 1,200 public events, and the Community Accelerator Grant Program administered by ArtsFund, which has awarded $30 million in funding to 930 arts and culture organizations across Washington state over the last three years.

Since the release of ChatGPT in late 2022, millions of people have started using large language models to access knowledge. And it's easy to understand their appeal: Ask a question, get a polished synthesis and move on – it feels like effortless learning.

However, a new paper I co-authored offers experimental evidence that this ease may come at a cost: When people rely on large language models to summarize information on a topic for them, they tend to develop shallower knowledge about it compared to learning through a standard Google search.

Co-author Jin Ho Yun and I, both professors of marketing, reported this finding in a paper based on seven studies with more than 10,000 participants. Most of the studies used the same basic paradigm: Participants were asked to learn about a topic – such as how to grow a vegetable garden – and were randomly assigned to do so by using either an LLM like ChatGPT or the “old-fashioned way,” by navigating links using a standard Google search.

No restrictions were put on how they used the tools; they could search on Google as long as they wanted and could continue to prompt ChatGPT if they felt they wanted more information. Once they completed their research, they were then asked to write advice to a friend on the topic based on what they learned.

The data revealed a consistent pattern: People who learned about a topic through an LLM versus web search felt that they learned less, invested less effort in subsequently writing their advice, and ultimately wrote advice that was shorter, less factual and more generic. In turn, when this advice was presented to an independent sample of readers, who were unaware of which tool had been used to learn about the topic, they found the advice to be less informative, less helpful, and they were less likely to adopt it.

We found these differences to be robust across a variety of contexts. For example, one possible reason LLM users wrote briefer and more generic advice is simply that the LLM results exposed users to less eclectic information than the Google results. To control for this possibility, we conducted an experiment where participants were exposed to an identical set of facts in the results of their Google and ChatGPT searches. Likewise, in another experiment we held constant the search platform – Google – and varied whether participants learned from standard Google results or Google's AI Overview feature.

The findings confirmed that, even when holding the facts and platform constant, learning from synthesized LLM responses led to shallower knowledge compared to gathering, interpreting and synthesizing information for oneself via standard web links.

Why did the use of LLMs appear to diminish learning? One of the most fundamental principles of skill development is that people learn best when they are actively engaged with the material they are trying to learn.

When we learn about a topic through Google search, we face much more “friction”: We must navigate different web links, read informational sources, and interpret and synthesize them ourselves.

While more challenging, this friction leads to the development of a deeper, more original mental representation of the topic at hand. But with LLMs, this entire process is done on the user's behalf, transforming learning from a more active to passive process.

To be clear, we do not believe the solution to these issues is to avoid using LLMs, especially given the undeniable benefits they offer in many contexts. Rather, our message is that people simply need to become smarter or more strategic users of LLMs – which starts by understanding the domains wherein LLMs are beneficial versus harmful to their goals.

Need a quick, factual answer to a question? Feel free to use your favorite AI co-pilot. But if your aim is to develop deep and generalizable knowledge in an area, relying on LLM syntheses alone will be less helpful.

As part of my research on the psychology of new technology and new media, I am also interested in whether it's possible to make LLM learning a more active process. In another experiment we tested this by having participants engage with a specialized GPT model that offered real-time web links alongside its synthesized responses. There, however, we found that once participants received an LLM summary, they weren't motivated to dig deeper into the original sources. The result was that the participants still developed shallower knowledge compared to those who used standard Google.

Building on this, in my future research I plan to study generative AI tools that impose healthy frictions for learning tasks – specifically, examining which types of guardrails or speed bumps most successfully motivate users to actively learn more beyond easy, synthesized answers. Such tools would seem particularly critical in secondary education, where a major challenge for educators is how best to equip students to develop foundational reading, writing and math skills while also preparing for a real world where LLMs are likely to be an integral part of their daily lives.

The Research Brief is a short take on interesting academic work.

Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers has resigned from OpenAI's board days after Congress released an extensive cache of emails with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, which included details of intimate affairs.

Summers is also a former president of Harvard University and a current professor. The university will open its own probe into Summers' connections with Epstein, reports the student newspaper, The Harvard Crimson. The university newspaper also reported that Summers will step back from public commitments. 

His departure comes a day after both the House and the Senate voted to release the Epstein files. Over the past few days, a House panel released years of email exchanges between Epstein and Summers, including one in which Summers asked for advice about pursuing a relationship with a woman he described as a mentee. 

In the exchanges, which took place between November 2018 and July 2019, Summers — who was married at the time — seemed to acknowledge his position of power over the woman he was mentoring. 

“She must be very confused or maybe wants to cut me off but wants professional connection a lot and so holds to it,” Summers wrote in a March 2019 email to Epstein. Epstein, who referred to himself early on in the exchanges as Summers' “wing man,” told him in a June 2019 text: “She is doomed to be with you.”

Later in the messages, Summers wrote that his “best shot” at getting his mentee to ostensibly sleep with him was that the woman found him “invaluable and interesting” and that “she can't have it without romance/sex.” Throughout June, Epstein urged him to play the “long game” and keep the woman in a “forced holding pattern.” 

Epstein was arrested in July 2019 for sex trafficking of minors and conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors.

Porsche needs a hit. In the first nine months of 2025, Porsche's operating profit plummeted by 99 percent compared to the same stint the year before. Yep, 99 percent. Profit has tanked for the auto brand with a track record of making billions.

The reasons for Porsche's misfortune are no secret. There's the hugely expensive product strategy shift that saw the dramatic scaling back of EV plans. There was Porsche scrapping projects to build its own EV batteries in-house and instead developing new combustion and hybrid models. Plus, the double hit of US tariffs and a slump in the Chinese market have left the German automaker reeling.

However, whether or not the EU decides to rewrite its EV transition timetable, the future for autos, sooner or later, will not be combustion but electric. So this means that European car companies playing the long game must still show their prowess in electrification. Which brings us to today's reveal of the final production Cayenne Electric and Cayenne Turbo Electric.

The Cayenne is Porsche's first fully electric SUV.

Costing $109,000 for the Cayenne, and $163,000 for the turbo version (£83,200 and £130,900 respectively in the UK), Porsche will be hoping that this, its first ever fully electric SUV, will present better long-term value for money than its formidable Taycan has, which saw unlucky owners lose half the value of the car in its first six months, pushing some into negative equity on the vehicles.

This new electric SUV is the most powerful production Porsche of all time, and the specs are fittingly mighty. The Cayenne Turbo shifts from 0 to 62 mph in 2.5 seconds, from 0 to 124 mph in 7.4 seconds, and goes on to a top speed of 162 mph. A new drive system develops up to 850 kW (1,156 PS) and up to 1,500 Nm of torque when the cars' Launch Control is activated. Interestingly, borrowing an innovation from motorsports, the Turbo has direct oil cooling of the electric motor on the rear axle for high continuous output.

The “entry-level” Cayenne model has 300 kW (408 PS) in normal operation and 325 kW (442 PS) and 835 Nm of torque with Launch Control. It can manage 0 to 62 mph in 4.8 seconds, on its way to a top speed of 143 mph.

Energy recovery for the Cayenne Electric is also impressive, with recuperative power matching Gen 3 Formula E levels of up to 600 kW. Both models can be specced with rear-axle steering too. This allows the rear wheels to move by up to 5 degrees, making it easier to make tight turns or shimmy into parking spots.

The Cayenne Electric is the first Porsche to have inductive charging at up to 11 kW.

Being electric, the battery is key, and these Cayenne models sport a newly developed 113 kWh battery, which gets double-sided cooling for better thermal management. The result? A WLTP range of up to 398 miles for the Cayenne Electric, and up to 387 miles for the Turbo. (The WLTP range is a measurement by the Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure, an industry standard.)

Thanks to its 800-volt charging technology, the Cayenne refills at a capacity of up to 390 kW, and “under specific conditions” even up to 400 kW. This means charges that bring the battery from 10 to 80 percent in less than 16 minutes, theoretically, and the addition of about 200 miles of range within 10 minutes.

However, what caught my attention at a preview recently in Germany was that this is the first Porsche to have inductive charging, and at up to 11 kW, too—so the same as a home EV wall charger. The system uses what is essentially a giant Qi charging puck on the floor under the front of the car. Thankfully, Porsche has gone to great trouble to make sure it cannot fry your pets.

The Cayenne Turbo Electric goes from 0 to 62 mph in 2.5 seconds, and on to a top speed of 162 mph.

As you can see here, the design language is distinctly Porsche, an evolution of the Cayenne rather than a radical rethink. But the tweaks have been worthwhile, delivering a drag coefficient of just 0.25, benefiting range and energy use. Sticking with this efficient theme, active aerodynamic elements include movable cooling air flaps in the nose, an adaptive roof spoiler, and active aeroblades at the rear of the Turbo. These extend the lateral tear-off edges, improving air flow, which, according to Porsche, leads to an increase in range at higher speeds.

Porsche has taken great pains to keep the interior layout under wraps, and the most striking part is undoubtedly the new curved infotainment screen called the Flow Display. I tried it out for about five minutes, and it's responsive and intuitive. It resembles a folding tablet left mostly open, but without the crease in the middle. It works surprisingly well, with menus and options appearing on the lower half of the curved screen, while maps, graphics, and displays sit above the “fold.” It makes the display feel part of the interior rather than plonked into it. Competitors will no doubt copy this.

Porsche's new Flow Display looks like a folding tablet but works surprisingly well.

More good news: If you've had enough of touchscreen controls, Porsche has wisely read the room and included physical controls for vital things like climate control and volume. But a digital key is available so you can stop carting around that darn fob and just use your smartphone to unlock the car.

What's it like to drive? I can't tell you. However, I can tell you what it's like to be driven in one: fast, and seemingly easy to feel where you are on the road and what the car is doing. More on that when Porsche lets me get behind the wheel, though. For now I can confirm it certainly has a “Porsche feel,” which is what the engineering team was shooting for.

There is one last mystery yet to be revealed for the Cayenne Electric, however. Despite seeming very proud of it at my technical briefing, no one at Porsche will tell me which AI model its new “Voice Pilot” uses. In fact, at the time of that briefing I was told no one there in Leipzig knew which LLM powered Voice Pilot, and thus enabled it to “understand complex, interrelated queries, recognize the context” and help it “respond like a real conversation partner.”

In the two months since that briefing, I've asked three times for an answer. Porsche still won't say. Could it be the company hasn't yet signed up to a specific model? Who knows. But it's very odd to shout about putting an AI helper into a car then avoid all questions about which model is powering it. Porsche will have to come clean at some point, of course.

The other thing Porsche doesn't want the likes of WIRED focusing on is the fact that this new Cayenne, coming to customers in the summer of 2026, isn't just electric. It's arriving in hybrid and full-on combustion-engined models too. Which means that this car, at its heart, is compromised in all the ways that cars are when their design is forced to accommodate ICE powertrains as well as electric.

You have to wonder what it would have been capable of if Porsche had held its nerve and gone all-in on EV.

Noctua's latest CPU cooler gets an all-black treatment


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


PC cooling specialist Noctua has introduced a Chromax variant of its latest flagship CPU cooler, the NH-D15 G2. Launched in July 2024 in its traditional brown and beige aesthetics, the cooler is now available in an all-black finish with a listed price of $189.90 in the U.S. on Amazon and €159.90 in Europe. That makes it $40 or €10 more expensive (depending on your region), unless you don't mind the company's traditional color scheme. Noctua has also introduced Chromax versions of the NF-A14x25r G2 (round frame) and NF-A14x25 G2 (square frame) 140mm PWM fans, which start at $44.90 in the U.S. and €39.90 in Europe.

According to Noctua CEO Roland Mossig, the G2 series products have been well-received by the PC-building community, and the company is confident that the new chromax.black versions will be suitable for users who prefer a “stealthy, unobtrusive look.”

The NH-D15 G2 features eight heat pipes as opposed to six on its predecessor. It also comes with denser asymmetrical fin stacks that are claimed to deliver 20% more surface area for convective heat dissipation. The cooler also features an offset design that is said to offer better clearance for the top PCIe x16 slot on most modern motherboards.

Rounding up the NH-D15 G2 are two NF-A14x25r G2 round-frame 140mm PWM fans which are made out of Noctua's patented Sterrox liquid-crystal polymer (LCP). This material is said to offer high tensile strength and low thermal expansion characteristics compared to traditional thermoplastics. The fans feature a Progressive Bend impeller design with a Centrifugal Turbulator hub, winglets, and a tight tip clearance of 0.7mm, which results in improved performance-to-noise efficiency over the previous generation models.

Noctua suggests that cooling efficiency and low-noise performance of the new Chromax lineup should be similar compared to the non-Chromax variants. In our in-depth review, the Noctua NH‑D15 G2 delivered improved thermal performance over the original NH-D15, cooling about 10W more load (around 240W sustained) while maintaining a quiet profile. We also recorded temperature drops of about 2-degrees celsius under mixed CPU and GPU loads, and an overall improvement in CPU temperatures of up to 3-degree celsius compared to its predecessor.

As the Trump Administration mulls slapping tariffs on foreign robotics, it's being warned that such a move could disrupt efforts to revive manufacturing in the United States.

The U.S. Commerce Department has begun collecting comments in an investigation authorized by section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which allows the agency to impose trade restrictions — such as tariffs or quotas — if imports are found to impair national security.

Opponents of tariffs, however, argue that the levies on foreign robotics would not only undermine national security but also hobble efforts to revive the U.S. manufacturing sector.

“A tariff on foreign robotics would raise the cost of capital investment for U.S. manufacturers who rely on this machinery to modernize and become more competitive,” explained Mark N. Vena, president and principal analyst at SmartTech Research, in Las Vegas.

“This increased expense on essential automation tools would squeeze profit margins, especially for small-to-mid-sized firms, making their final products more expensive compared to international rivals who can acquire the same technology tariff-free,” he told TechNewsWorld.

“Essentially, tariffs could delay or derail the push to increase productivity and reshore manufacturing, undermining the very renaissance they are meant to protect,” he added.

Seil Kim, vice president of DN Solutions, a South Korean manufacturer of computer numerical control (CNC) and metal-cutting machine tools, and Daniel Medrea, executive vice president of DN Solutions America, a U.S. subsidiary established in 1994, pointed out in comments submitted to Commerce that while large corporations often capture headlines, the backbone of American manufacturing consists of thousands of small and medium enterprises.

“These companies, often family-owned job shops, depend on access to affordable, high-quality machine tools to remain competitive,” they stated.

“For many small manufacturers, purchasing a CNC machine represents a major capital investment that must deliver returns for decades,” they explained. “They need equipment that is not only capable but also supported by readily available service, training, and spare parts.”

“Imposing tariffs or restrictions on our equipment would place these critical capabilities out of reach for many small businesses, forcing them either to delay modernization or to seek lower-quality alternatives that could compromise their competitiveness,” they maintained. “The changes in price competitiveness could also increase the likelihood of substitution with lower-cost Chinese products, potentially posing a security threat.”

American companies need robots to lower labor costs, increase productivity, and assure factory uptime, added Rob Enderle, president and principal analyst of the Enderle Group, an advisory services firm, in Bend, Ore.

“In addition, existing robots become obsolete or wear out, and it is easier to replace robots with those from the same manufacturer than to switch providers,” he told TechNewsWorld.

Tariffs will also put U.S. manufacturers at a disadvantage when purchasing equipment in global markets. “Tariffs are most typically passed on to the buyer,” explained Enderle. “Given the robot market is very competitive, making margins largely too tight to absorb much in the way of tariffs.”

Vena agreed that it is highly unlikely that foreign robotics companies will significantly cut prices to absorb the full cost of a U.S. tariff. “This is because manufacturers in key producing nations like Japan and Germany have strong, growing markets elsewhere and have diversified their global sales, making them less reliant on U.S. market access,” he explained.

“Furthermore,” he continued, “some foreign manufacturers already benefit from government subsidies, giving them little incentive to sacrifice margins just to offset a U.S. tariff.”

“There's a lot of interest in these products globally,” added Paul Steidler, a senior fellow at the Lexington Institute, a public policy think tank in Arlington, Va.

“This is not some stale old school commodity product where tariffs may have some beneficial impact,” he told TechNewsWorld. “A lot of these robots are highly specialized.”

“Tariffs are just going to up the price and cost for U.S. manufacturers, and that's going to impair productivity and manufacturing growth significantly,” he said.

Ed Brzytwa, vice president of international trade, and Michael Petricone, senior vice president of government affairs, at the Arlington, Va.-based Consumer Technology Association (CTA), which represents more than 1,200 member companies in the U.S. technology industry, concurred that tariffs on robotics and industrial machinery — products that constitute critical inputs in manufacturing — would significantly increase costs for equipment and machinery on factory floors, discourage investment into new U.S. production capacity and threaten jobs.

“This is underscored by the fact that domestic production of critical inputs alone is insufficient to sustain the needs of U.S. manufacturers,” they wrote in comments to Commerce. “Currently, even if operating at full capacity, the U.S. manufacturing industry could only produce 84% of the inputs manufacturers need for production. Thus, 16% of manufacturing inputs must be imported in order for U.S. manufacturers to operate.”

“In fact, in key sectors such as automotive manufacturing, domestic suppliers of critical machinery for manufacturing and assembly already suffer from overcapacity, illustrating the reality that current U.S. supply cannot meet growing demand for advanced machinery,” they continued.

“Subjecting robotics and industrial machinery to tariffs would further prevent U.S. manufacturers from building, modernizing, and operating facilities,” they added.

The CTA urged Commerce to exclude industrial robots, industrial machinery, automated guided vehicles (AGVs), and other complete computer-controlled mechanical systems, including LiDAR modules, from any trade action. These technologies are critical to U.S. industrial capacity, enable reshoring, and support globally competitive production.

Because production lines have been optimized around these systems, replacing them would require years of reengineering, in turn delaying domestic investment and manufacturing expansion, the CTA added.

Vena pointed out that the U.S. currently lacks the domestic capacity to produce all the industrial robots needed for its manufacturing base.

“An estimated 80% of robots bought in the U.S. are manufactured overseas, primarily in countries like Japan, Germany, and China,” he explained. “This trend is partly a legacy issue, as countries like Japan and Germany historically excelled at producing the specialized, high-precision machine tools required to make these robots.”

“Since the U.S. does not have the capacity to meet demand, tariffs would raise costs without providing a viable domestic alternative,” he added.

He noted that several initiatives have been launched to increase the number of robots produced in the United States. “Programs like the National Robotics Initiative — known as NRI 3.0 — and the Advanced Robotics for Manufacturing Institute invest in R&D and public-private partnerships,” he said.

“Additionally, broader acts like the CHIPS Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law include funding that indirectly supports the advanced technologies and facilities critical to the robotics ecosystem.”

Steidler recommended that the U.S. court Japan and its robot companies to invest directly in the U.S. and to make joint investments with U.S. companies for robot development here. “Japan is a leader in manufacturing here,” he said. “They're a good friend, a good ally of the United States, and they should be embraced on this.”

He also recommended adopting lower tax rates and faster depreciation of investments, as well as fostering a climate in which U.S. companies can acquire foreign robotics companies and bring their operations to the U.S., or find ways to work with them jointly.

“Those actions will have much more immediate and positive benefits than tariffs, which are likely to raise prices and create a lot of disruption here at home,” he added.

Shivi Sharma spent a decade working in credit risk at places like American Express and Varo Bank.  

At some point, she realized teams were spending equal amounts of time analyzing all types of loans — regardless of whether it was worth $100,000 or $5 million — meaning assessing smaller loans was ultimately an unprofitable and time-consuming process for lenders.  

She and her husband, Utsav Shah, realized there was an opportunity here.  

“She watched as the vast majority of small business owners couldn't access the capital they needed to grow, simply because the economics didn't work for banks,” Shah told TechCrunch.  

“Between our skills in building AI-powered decision-making systems at scale and our expertise in credit risk and fraud risk assessments in banking in financial services, we realized we could apply next-gen AI agent workflows to solve this decades-old problem,” he continued. 

The married couple decided to launch Kaaj in 2024, a company that helps automate credit risk analysis so that underwriting no longer takes days, but minutes. Kaaj said it's processed more than $5 billion worth of loan applications, with clients including Amur Equipment Finance and Fundr. The company announced on Wednesday a $3.8 million seed round from Kindred Ventures and Better Tomorrow Ventures.  

The product works like this: A small business applies for a loan, submitting all the needed documents (like financial statements, bank statements, and tax returns) — typically, when this happens, underwriters spend days manually verifying all this information and logging it into their Loan Origination System (LOS).  

Kaaj uses AI to identify, classify, verify, and organize information into LOS. It also runs assessments to check for document tampering for the underwriter fraud team. It integrates into existing Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems like Salesforce, HubSpot, or Microsoft and even shows a lender if a business is meeting the criteria of a lender's policy.  

“This allows a team processing 500 applications monthly to handle 20,000 applications with the same staff, making smaller loans economically viable,” Shah, the company's CEO, said.  

The hope is that more small businesses will be able to access loans from banks because it becomes more cost-efficient for a bank to investigate them.  

Others in the market include Middesk, Ocrolus, and MoneyThumb. Sharma hopes that Kaaj will stand out from the competition by automating the entire credit analysis process rather than parts of it.  

“We do this by deploying agentic AI workflows that mimic their teams, to help lenders analyze end-to-end loan packages,” she said.  

The fresh capital will be used to help accelerate product development and expand across independent and small business lenders. “We're focused on enhancing our AI agent capabilities, expanding our module offerings, and scaling our customer base of lenders and brokers beyond our current footprint.”  

Overall, Shah and Sharma hope Kaaj can in some ways “revolutionize” small business lending, bringing automation to what is still a very paper-heavy process.  

“By automating the science of credit analysis, we free up human underwriters to focus on the art of deal-making and subjective assessment, which is their true competitive advantage,” he said.

Read AI, which made its mark analyzing online meetings and messages, is expanding its focus beyond the video call and the email inbox to the physical world, in a sign of the growing industry trend of applying artificial intelligence to offline and spontaneous work data.

The Seattle-based startup on Wednesday introduced a new system called Operator that captures and analyzes interactions throughout the workday, including impromptu hallway conversations and in-person meetings in addition to virtual calls and emails, working across a wide range of popular apps and platforms. 

With the launch, Read AI is releasing new desktop clients for Windows and macOS, and a new Android app to join its existing iOS app and browser-based features.

For offline conversations — like a coffee chat or a conference room huddle — users can open the Read AI app and manually hit record. The system then transcribes that audio and incorporates it into the company's AI system for broader insights into each user's meetings and workday. 

It comes as more companies bring workers back to the office for at least part of the week. According to new Read AI research, 53% of meetings now happen in-person or without a calendar invite — up from 47% in 2023 — while a large number of workday interactions occur outside of meetings entirely.

In a break from others in the industry, Operator works via smartphone in these situations and does not require a pendant or clip-on recording device. 

“I don't think we'd ever build a device, because I think the phones themselves are good enough,” said Read AI CEO David Shim in a recent interview, as featured on this week's GeekWire Podcast.

This differs from hardware-first competitors like Limitless and Plaud, which require users to purchase and wear dedicated devices to capture “real-world” audio throughout the day.

While these companies argue that a wearable provides a frictionless, “always-on” experience without draining your phone's battery, Read AI is betting that the friction of charging and wearing a separate gadget is a bigger hurdle than simply using the device you already have.

To address the privacy concerns of recording in-person chats, Read AI relies on user compliance rather than an automated audible warning. When a user hits record on the desktop or mobile app, a pop-up prompts them to declare that the conversation is being captured, via voice or text. On mobile, a persistent reminder remains visible on the screen for the duration of the recording.

Founded in 2021 by David Shim, Robert Williams, and Elliott Waldron, Read AI has raised more than $80 million and landed major enterprise customers for its cross-platform AI meeting assistant and productivity tools. It now reports 5 million monthly active users, with 24 million connected calendars to date.

Operator is included in all of Read AI's existing plans at no additional cost.

Swedish vibe coding unicorn Lovable has doubled its annual recurring revenue (ARR) to $200 million in just four months, co-founder and CEO Anton Osika said on stage at the 2025 Slush technology conference in Helsinki, Finland.

The milestone comes just four months after the year-old company surpassed $100 million in ARR in July.

Osika credited the AI-assisted coding software maker's decision not to move to Silicon Valley as the main reason for its success thus far. Osika said Lovable decided to stay in Europe despite getting a lot of early advice that the company would only be successful if it left the region and relocated to the U.S.

“It was tempting, but I really resisted that,” Osika said. “I [can] sit here now and say, ‘look, guys, you can build a global AI company from this country'. There is more available talent if you have a strong mission, and you have a lot of urgency coming together as a group and working.”

He added that the fact that the AI market in Europe is not as high-paced as the market in Silicon Valley has worked to his company's benefit.

The company “flipped the script” by bringing strong talent from Silicon Valley companies like Notion and Gusto to work in-person in Stockholm, investor Zhenya Loginov, a partner at Accel, said. 

Osika also credited the company's open-source community for continuing to improve its technology.

“We just see all of these people in the community driving forward,” Osika said. “They've been active voices on Discord for, I think, the last 1,000 hours, debating some kind of WordPress operation. That was powering what we're doing.”

Lovable's milestone comes as vibe coding continues to gobble up venture capital and see soaring traction among users. Last week AI-coding assistant Cursor announced it raised $2.3 billion in a new funding round that valued the company at $29.3 billion in a round Accel also helped lead.

Lovable has raised more than $225 million in venture funding since it was founded a year ago. The startup most recently raised a $200 million Series A round in July led by Accel in addition to more than 20 other investors. That round valued the company at $1.8 billion.

Great news: you can now ride a Zoox robotaxi if you're in San Francisco. Yes, you heard me right! Zoox, I said. I'm sure I don't need to remind you that in 2020, Amazon bought an Australia-founded robotaxi company called Zoox for $1.2 billion, and that not long after that acquisition, it rolled out a prototype that looks like a Pokémon on wheels. On Tuesday, Zoox debuted a program called “Zoox Explorers” that invites users in San Francisco to download the Zoox app, and get on the waitlist to potentially take a free ride in one of these—I guess you could call it a “buggy,” since Zoox doesn't want us to call it a car. Using the app could already get you a free ride starting in September, but only if you were going up or down the Las Vegas Strip. The Zoox vehicle has a plausible reason for looking so cutesy. It's a purpose-built robotaxi with no steering wheel or pedals. It resembles nothing so much as certain ferris wheel gondolas—an interior that only has room for two bench seats at opposite ends, where passengers face one another instead of all looking forward. San Francisco's Mission, SoMa, and Design District neighborhoods will be covered by the Zoox Explorers program—areas where a Zoox could plausibly encounter a competing Waymo, and there's simply no telling what would happen then.Once you're on the waiting list, according to Zoox, the company will “notify you when you can join the preview and request a ride.” Also, according to the Zoox site, the rider “can't take over the driving,” but is provided controls for the temperature and music. You can also “initiate an emergency stop if you must exit the robotaxi.” I can only assume this last feature is known as the “puke button” around the Zoox office.

The mid-90s was arguably the period in PC history with the most whiplash-inducing changes. The arrival of 3D acceleration cards, the transition from plain-textbox DOS to fancy Windows 95, and the advent of the Internet all happened at once. This rapidly shifting landscape posed quite the challenge for game developers, as they had to consider writing their games for DOS, Windows 95, or both.

In an exceedingly detailed writeup, Fabien Sanglard explains how the OG Quake got its support for TCP/IP and was arguably the only game that used the same executable with native support for both operating systems.

Many games of the era, like Fallout, Grand Theft Auto, and Mortal Kombat 3, would ship separate executables for DOS and Windows 95. However, id Software wanted Quake to use nearly the same executable (and codebase), and it wanted the game to have support for TCP/IP, the Internet communications protocol. Playing remotely with more than one person was the fresh new thing back then; true multiplayer was often limited to home or office networks.

Fulfilling both requirements at once was no easy feat for Quake. DOS was long in the tooth by the time of the game's development and needed a ton of hacks to use all of the hardware capabilities of the time, namely but not only more than 640 KB of memory.

To get around DOS' limitations, games started including DPMI (DOS Protected Mode Interface) extenders like Watcom's DOS/4GW or CWSDPMI. These extenders offered a standardized memory interface, multitasking, and other capabilities. The extender technically served as a micro-kernel, so think of it as a DOS replacement. Typically, games would ship with a target DPMI server and be their single client.

During Quake's development, id wanted to shift from the (at-the-time) proprietary Watcom compiler used in Doom to the open-source djgpp toolkit in a bid to make cross-platform development far easier. Heck, Quake even had a DEC Alpha port, if anyone remembers those. In a shift from the usual arrangement, id asked djgpp's engineers to ensure that its DPMI client supported Windows 95's included DPMI server in addition to CWSDPMI.

The problem was that although DPMI was a standard, its specification was not finalized until the late 90s. That meant that in practice, client software was normally beholden to one specific server. But the djgpp team delivered, and senior Microsoft kernel engineer Raymond Chen put it plainly:

"The fact that programs seem to run mostly okay in spite of running under a foreign extender is either completely astonishing or totally obvious, depending on your point of view."

Quake had native TCP/IP support coded in, yes, but since it was cross-platform, it needed a way to interact with Windows 95's Winsock TCP/IP layer. Additionally, in-game match/server browsers were a new concept at the time, so id killed two grunts with one rocket by enlisting the help of Mpath Interactive and integrating its Mplayer match-making software into Quake.

Mplayer's software comprised two pieces: a "Gizmo" game browser that would autodetect any Mplayer-compatible games you had installed and list game rooms for them, and a solution called the "Chunnel", the component that would actually talk to Windows' TCP/IP stack.

 




To round out cross-compatibility, Quake also shipped with Mpath's genvxd.dll. This is a virtual device driver that translated DOS networking functionality (that itself uses the now-standard BSD socket function calls) to Windows 95's Winsock. Once that was fitted in, the journey was finally complete, and Quake would run seamlessly in both DOS or Windows, without needing separate installers or executables.

After laying off thousands of HHS workers, firing America's top vaccine experts, scaring people away from using Tylenol, and hiring a CDC director who has no medical training whatsoever, health czar Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is casting about for new ways to “improve” America's healthcare system. The solution he's come up with? Figure out how AI can make everything better.

Kennedy doesn't seem to know how AI can make healthcare better, which is probably why his agency is holding a competition that will give money to whoever can figure it out. On Tuesday, the Department of Health and Human Services announced that it would be holding what it calls the Caregiving Artificial Intelligence Prize Competition. The point of the competition is to “fund and recognize innovators” who develop tools that can “support caregivers” (i.e., healthcare workers that take care of elderly and disabled Americans), and support “employers by improving efficiency, scheduling, and training in the caregiving workforce.” The winner of the competition will get a $2 million prize, the government has said.

“America's caregivers carry our nation's most vulnerable on their shoulders, and they do it with a strength and devotion that rarely gets the recognition it deserves,” said Kennedy in a prepared statement. “With the Caregiver AI Challenge, we are advancing the goals of the Make America Healthy Again Strategy Report by mobilizing innovation to lighten caregivers' load and ensure every family has the support they need to care for the people they love.”

AI has shown some promising applications in the world of healthcare (it has shown some promise in automating the early detection of cancer, for instance). However, it's unclear what, exactly HHS is looking to produce here. The language on the website is pretty vague, stating merely that winning “solutions will empower caregivers, protect dignity, and expand access to high-quality care at home.” Gizmodo reached out to HHS for more information about its competition.

While leaning into automation to make American healthcare better, Kennedy also seemed to take steps to advance his own unique agenda within the federal health bureaucracy. This week, it was reported that the government had hired a key figure from his MAHA movement, Calley Means. It was reported that Means, who has been critical of highly processed food, and who owns his own health company, had been hired as a senior advisor at HHS.

Kennedy was also in the news this week because the internet has been collectively laughing at the memoir put out by Olivia Nuzzi, the journalist who admitted to a “digital” tryst with Kennedy last year. Nuzzi was placed on leave from New York magazine in September of last year, after admitting to having the supposed affair while covering Kennedy as a political candidate. She later left the magazine, and is now the West Coast editor of Vanity Fair.

It was in physical education class when Laila Gutierrez swapped out self-harm for a new vice.

The freshman from Phoenix had long struggled with depression and would cut her arms to feel something. Anything. The first drag from a friend's vape several years ago offered the shy teenager a new way to escape.

This article was copublished with The 74, a nonprofit news outlet covering education in the US. Sign up for its newsletters here.

She quit cutting but got hooked on nicotine. Her sadness got harder to carry after her uncle died, and she felt she couldn't turn to her grieving parents for comfort. Bumming fruity vapes at school became part of her routine.

“I would ask my friends who had them, ‘I'm going through a lot, can I use it?'” Gutierrez, now 18, told The 74. “Or ‘I failed my test and I feel like smoking would be better than cutting my wrists.'”

It worked until she got caught.

Like students across the country, Gutierrez got dragged into a nicotine-fueled war between vape manufacturers—including a company that leveraged online advertisements on the websites of Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network to hook kids on e-cigarettes—and educators, who've turned to digital surveillance tools and discipline to crack down on the youngest users. Gutierrez was suspended for a week after she was nabbed vaping in a crowded school bathroom during her lunch hour.

An in-depth investigation by The 74 reveals how nicotine-addicted teens, who often begin vaping under social pressure or, like Gutierrez, to cope with hardship, are routinely kicked out of school instead of receiving meaningful services that could steer them away from tobacco and help them break free of their vape pens.

Candid interviews with a dozen high schoolers and recent graduates from across the country reveal how vaping has become ubiquitous in schools. The battery-powered nicotine sticks are more than an addiction: They define students' social status, friend groups, and coping strategies years before they're 21 and legally old enough to buy them.

“At my school, vaping starts because you want to be part of the popular crowd, you want to get invited to parties, you want to feel like you're a part of a community,” said Ayaan Moledina, a 16-year-old from Austin, Texas. “And you start doing those things because you're pressured into doing it.” Moledina says he doesn't vape and has been excluded socially as a result.

Public records obtained by The 74 from a vape-detector pilot program at Minneapolis Public Schools presents a unique window into the severity of the problem and of educators' efforts to contain it. The main battlefield in the fight is the school bathroom. As they have for generations, teens take cover in the bathroom to socialize and smoke, but because vapes allow them to consume nicotine more discreetly than traditional cigarettes, district leaders are also embracing technological advancements to police them.

Purchasing records from schools across the country show that districts are spending millions to install sensors in student bathrooms—once considered a privacy no-go for electronic surveillance—to alert them to changes in air quality. The 74's analysis of the data from Minneapolis Public Schools reveals that the vape detectors brought a spike in school discipline, but they also produced a near-endless stream of alerts that could overwhelm district administrators.

For University of Texas master's student Cameron Samuels, who founded the youth-led group Students Engaged in Advancing Texas as a freshman in college, all this means is that schools are spending money on invasive tech that could go to mentorship programs “where teachers and educators can support students, meeting us where we're at.” They argue that the detectors, often equipped with microphones, are no less intrusive than security cameras.

“Surveillance is only a diagnosis,” Samuels said of the decision to use sensors to counter student vaping. “It only recognizes symptoms of a failed system without actually solving them.”

In Minneapolis, the $100,000 pilot program placed sensors in the bathrooms of two high schools and two middle schools with high rates of reported vaping incidents in 2022. The result, The 74's investigation reveals, was a marked increase in students being punished for vaping in the months that followed.

Across the four campuses, a student was disciplined for vaping every 3.1 school days on average in the two years before the devices were activated and inundated administrators with tens of thousands of alerts. In a nine-month period after they were deployed in September 2024, a student was disciplined for the same offense every 1.4 days.

The increase was particularly pronounced at Anwatin Middle School, where in the 2022-23 school year, there were 15 vape-related disciplinary incidents. During the 2024-25 school year, after the sensors were installed, disciplinary actions for vaping reached 67.

Across the four campuses, at least half of the vape-related disciplinary incidents occurred in school bathrooms. Nearly 81 percent led to suspensions. Just 7 percent led to a referral to an alcohol and drug abuse counselor, according to the discipline logs, and after the vape detectors were installed, the rate of treatment referrals declined compared to the average over the two years before.

While the number of alerts was far greater at the two high schools, it was the younger students at the two middle schools who were more likely to be removed from their classrooms.

The escalation in vape-related suspensions in Minneapolis comes as federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data show teen nicotine use dropping since a 2019 high that reflected e-cigarettes' growing hold on the market. In 2024, some 8.1 percent of middle and high school students reported using tobacco products within the last 30 days, according to the most recent results from the CDC's National Youth Tobacco Survey. Nearly three-quarters of them reported vaping e-cigarettes.

Stanford Medicine pediatrician Bonnie Halpern-Felsher, who helped create a tobacco prevention toolkit and curriculum that's used in schools across the country, has found higher youth vaping rates than the CDC figures. And a survey of educators' perspectives released in September about student vaping reports the behavior is “everywhere now,” especially at “ground zero”: the bathrooms.

The survey was published by the Truth Initiative, a national nonprofit that is focused on preventing nicotine addiction among youth and young adults and opposes school discipline as a means of combating it. Some students were brazen—vaping openly in school hallways—while others hid e-cigarettes in bathroom fixtures, ceiling tiles and tampon dispensers, the survey found.

Educators who were polled voiced concern about students' “distracting preoccupation” with vaping and how constant bathroom breaks interrupted learning, said Jennifer Kreslake, the senior vice president of Truth Initiative's Schroeder Institute.

“It also takes away from the teacher's ability to do their jobs,” Kreslake said. “Their primary jobs are not monitoring vapes around campus, and it's taking them away from what they're in the school to do.”

In Lancaster, South Carolina, county health workers spent more than $150,000 on about 70 Triton-made vape sensors that are scheduled to go live at local schools next month. Officials said they chose the Triton sensors, in particular, because they go beyond vape detection to identify “aggression,” “keywords associated with vandalism,” and “loitering.”

School officials' previous efforts with vape detection centered on student discipline, said Ashlie Harder, the prevention director at Counseling Services of Lancaster.

“The goal for them was punitive—they wanted to catch the students,” Harder said. “They wanted the students to get whatever the disciplinary action was. That was the plan.”

Harder, who had already been working with the district to stop schools from sending kids home for vaping, hopes to change that. Her office, which serves as the county's commission for drug and alcohol abuse, secured the new, high-tech Triton sensors earlier this year with the goal for school officials to “leave it for us” to do in-school tobacco prevention programming based on the Stanford toolkit with young people caught vaping by the devices.

Lancaster County School District officials said they hope the sensors will prevent vaping on campus while also providing a new layer of bathroom security. School-based police officers will have access to the alerts in an effort to prevent fights and to stop students from camping out in the restrooms and skipping class.

Lonnie Plyler, the district's director of safety and transportation, said nicotine use isn't the full extent of the problem—students have also been bringing marijuana vapes to school.

“We hope that it will deter these people from actually bringing it into the schools and using it, knowing that we're actually monitoring it and can see it,” Plyler said. The vape detectors help create a process, he said, where students are “being punished through the school and possibly law enforcement.”

Gutierrez, the student from Phoenix, was suspended in September 2024 after a school security guard caught her vaping in a bathroom stall. It's also common for schools to station monitors outside bathrooms to sniff out vaping and for some restrooms to be locked altogether as a blanket deterrent.

Getting kicked out of school didn't make Gutierrez's situation any easier. An online quiz she was required to take during those days depicted vaping as ruining her life, she said, offering no help for her depression and making her feel ashamed.

“When I went back to school, I felt the eyes of the security guards,” she said. “It made me feel like I was in a jail.”

It was 2 pm, in late January, when Anwatin Middle School assistant principal Nate Lee logged a new disciplinary action against two of his ​​334 students.

As part of the pilot program, Anwatin was supplied last year with HALO vape detection sensors. The plastic, ceiling-mounted discs are sold by a subsidiary of the communications giant Motorola and are designed to notify administrators of vapor, smoke, and with certain microphone-equipped models, gunshots. Officials installed the devices in two boys' and two girls' bathrooms.

Once all 29 sensors across the two middle schools and two high schools went live in September 2024, administrators began receiving real-time alerts notifying them of suspected vaping, smoking—and evidence of students masking vape plumes with pungent aerosols like Axe Body Spray.

At Anwatin, administrators responded to vape sensor alerts with fervor, student disciplinary records show, often resulting in suspensions. In the January incident, a seventh and an eighth grader were suspended after “investigative efforts” found they were in the bathroom “at a time when the vape detector monitoring system alerted staff to illicit activity.”

“Students denied involvement,” disciplinary records note, “but were both found to be in the bathroom.”

The 74's analysis of vape detection alerts suggest the sensors are accurate—or at least go off most when kids are likely to be in the building. Few alerts occurred outside normal school hours, according to the logs.

Over a seven-month period between September 2024 and April 2025, the HALO sensors went off more than 45,000 times across the four Minneapolis campuses. On any given school day, the data reveal, Minneapolis educators at the four schools received an average of 412 alerts—roughly one every minute. On their most active day, the sensors alerted school officials to vaping 755 times.

The sheer number of alerts raises the question of whether school officials can reasonably respond to them, and if not, whether they're an effective way to stop students from vaping at school—or curb their habit in general.

Youth cigarette prevention efforts have existed in schools since the 1960s after a landmark Surgeon General report linked smoking to deleterious health consequences, including lung cancer and heart disease. Technological advancements in e-cigarettes were sold as healthier alternatives for adult cigarette smokers, but the vapes have been blamed for breeding a new generation of nicotine addicts. By the time the vape detectors emerged on the market, kids were already hooked.

Student interviews reveal the degree to which vaping culture has become fully ingrained in student life, with teens describing the allure of nicotine as so strong that addiction is nearly inevitable. For some teens who are sick of it, vaping has become a reason to avoid school bathrooms altogether.

“They do it at school, they do it in the bathrooms, they do it with their friends, and they think it's cool, but they don't understand the long-term impacts of it,” said Moledina, the Austin teen, who is the federal policy director for Students Engaged in Advancing Texas.

Over the summer, he and dozens of other students from across the country convened in a cafeteria at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota, to discuss the privacy implications and potential harms of vape detection sensors and other digital surveillance tools increasingly employed in schools.

Even here, where adults warned teens about vape sensors' intrusiveness, students offered varying perspectives about the factors that lead to teen vaping—and the best strategies to prevent it. Nathan Wanna, a 14-year-old freshman from St. Paul, said he wished the sensors were installed in the bathrooms at his school.

“I say it might be an invasion of privacy, but if it's needed, it should be in there,” Wanna said. “I wouldn't see my friends tempted by peer pressure or the pain they go through to start doing that.”

The four Minneapolis pilot schools saw a surge in vape alerts just before noon, suggesting students used the lull during lunch break to get their fix. Vaping was by far the most common trigger, the HALO logs show, accounting for 74 percent of alerts. Smoking cigarettes accounted for another 25 percent. In just 87 incidents, the sensors were triggered by tetrahydrocannabinol, the mind-shifting compound in cannabis, which can be consumed by vaping or other delivery methods.

The high schools were also overrepresented in the vape logs, even after accounting for their larger student populations, a finding that correlates with a higher percentage of tobacco users among older teens compared to those in middle school. Nearly 93 percent of vape alerts were registered on the sensors at Camden and Roosevelt high schools while just 7 percent were logged at Anwatin and Andersen United middle schools. Yet the middle schools accounted for 53 percent of all disciplinary write-ups for vaping. The disparity in the alert-to-discipline ratio suggests that high school administrators may have gotten buried by the noise.

The 74 provided Minneapolis Public Schools with a list of key findings from its investigation but officials didn't agree to an interview or provide a written statement. Plans for vape detection beyond the four-campus pilot program at the district are unclear. But No Tech Criminalization in Education, a national network of advocates and researchers that convened the student gathering in St. Paul this summer, has called on the district to give it up. When Minneapolis students are caught by the sensors, “they're just told to go home,” said local activist Marika Pfefferkorn, a NOTICE Coalition founder.

“Teachers and administrators have said that with vaping and vape detection, that we're treating some students as if it's a mental health issue … and then for other students, it's a behavior issue,” Pfefferkorn said.

The analysis accounts for a blackout period from early December 2024 through the end of January when the logs provided by Minneapolis Public Schools show zero sensor alerts. The data may have been excluded in error because the student disciplinary records provided to The 74 show some vape-related incidents during that same period, including several that cite the sensors.

While a single vaping session could trigger multiple alerts, records indicate such occurrences are rare. Fewer than 5 percent of alerts were within 10 seconds of another notification from the same device. Of the pings across the four schools, just over half occurred 60 seconds or more after another alert on the same device, meaning it's likely the sensors were picking up separate vaping incidents.

IPVM, a surveillance industry research firm that runs a 12,000-square-foot testing facility in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, has conducted audits on the HALO sensors, alongside similar devices, for several years and found they're generally effective at their intended purpose: detecting plumes of vapor.

But the sensors aren't foolproof—they could be beaten by blowing the vapor into a bottle or a jacket sleeve—and there were other drawbacks, including alerts delayed by more than 20 seconds, the firm found. The detectors' efficacy is highly dependent on where they're installed, said Nikita Ermolaev, an IPVM senior research engineer.

In Minneapolis, the number of vape detections decreased over time, though it's unclear if that's because the sensors were a deterrent for students or if their placement was fine-tuned.

“How big is the school bathroom, how high are the ceilings?” Ermolaev said. “How savvy are the students when it comes to workarounds? Are there windows in the bathroom that you can blow vape to?”

After asking The 74 for a list of detailed questions, Motorola did not provide answers in writing or otherwise and did not respond to follow-up requests for comment.

In its marketing efforts to schools, Motorola has highlighted federal pandemic relief funds as a resource districts could use to finance the HALO sensors, each of which cost about $1,000. The company has also pointed to settlement money from lawsuits against e-cigarette maker Juul. In 2022, Juul reportedly agreed to pay $1.7 billion to settle more than 5,000 lawsuits, including by school districts. Many alleged it knowingly and unlawfully advertised tobacco to minors.

School systems identified by Motorola as using Juul settlement money to buy the sensors include those in Stockton, California, and Fairfax, Virginia, which received $3.2 million from the tobacco company.

These days, Elijah Edminster works at Vape City, a chain with more than 250 locations in multiple states and ambitions to become “the #1 vape shop in the USA.”

But a few years before he started selling vapes at the shop north of Austin—Edminster said he's required to ID all his customers and none are underage—he was a high schooler who got sent to an alternative school as punishment for vaping. It all happened after he took a hit his junior year in the school's main bathroom.

“None of our bathrooms have doors or anything so, you know, it's all pretty open,” said Edminster, now 21. He said he met up with a classmate in a stall to buy a THC vape pen, “tested out the little thing,” and got caught by school staff on his way out the door.

The school official “pulls us off to the side and starts questioning us, basically talking about how it was suspicious that we were in there,” said Edminster, who was 18 at the time. “And he was like, ‘Oh, I have this vape detector that goes off, yada yada, and it went off. So what does that mean?'”

Edminster said he confessed after school officials threatened to call the police. Under a new state law, he was assigned to an alternative program housed in an “inactive, old” elementary” school for a month.

Thirty days is a long time to be away from regular classes, and the impact of schools' punitive vaping crackdown has been particularly pronounced in Texas. School districts in the state have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to deploy sensors across hundreds of campuses, district procurement records show. In 2023, Texas state leaders passed a law requiring that students, like Edminster, be placed in an alternative school if caught vaping on campus.

The number of kids removed from traditional classrooms after the law was enacted grew by thousands—so high that state lawmakers backtracked this spring and returned vape-related disciplinary decisions to local districts.

Andrew Hairston, the director of the Education Justice Project at the nonprofit Texas Appleseed, said the state's two-year, anti-vaping enforcement effort has become “one of the most pressing things that we're working on.”

“A lot of parents are reaching out to us—or young people—and telling us that their entry into the school-to-prison pipeline is fueled by vaping,” Hairston said. “It's just a really unfortunate reality, especially for so many working-class Black and brown families across the state who are disproportionately impacted by punitive vaping policies.”

A year after his first offense, Edminster said school administrators used a detector to bust him again, this time for trying to mask a vape cloud with cologne. He was suspended for three days.

“I still smoke, I still vape, you know what I mean?” he said. “I'm trying to quit vaping, but ya, [getting suspended] didn't really do too much. It definitely just made me try and stop at school — but not even that much.”

Students should not be suspended for vaping but instead made to attend tobacco cessation programs, said Halpern-Felsher, the pediatrics professor behind the widely used tobacco prevention toolkit and director of Stanford's REACH Lab. And even if kids are sent home—where they're likely to vape more, she points out—they should still be offered help quitting in school.

Halpern-Felsher's own data suggests the CDC's teen vaping numbers are an undercount, and based on her conversations with educators, she's challenged the narrative that the country is “going in the right direction.”

She worries the vape detectors in school bathrooms could be tripped up by both false positives and negatives. While something as simple as hairspray could trigger an alarm, she said, delayed alerts could give school administrators bad information that could lead to disciplinary action against the wrong student.

Minnesota's own state health department has cautioned against using discipline to stop youth vaping, as have two leading tobacco prevention organizations, The Truth Initiative and the American Lung Association. Last year, American Lung Association president and CEO Harold Wimmer called out vape detectors in particular.

“Students need additional education about the health risks and to be provided with resources to help them quit for good,” he said in a statement. “Teens should not be punished for being addicted to a product that was aggressively marketed to them on social media, through celebrities and with kid-friendly flavors.”

Garrison Parthemore observed the prevalence of vaping in his Pennsylvania high school and felt the bad habit was changing the lives of his peers for the worse. So he teamed up with his brother and a friend to do something about it.

“Every time we'd walk into the school bathroom we were met with a cloud of smoke,” Parthemore told The 74 in an interview. “We knew if there's a problem at our school, it's probably a problem everywhere.”

In 2020, the trio built a vape detector and entered their creation into a state STEM competition. The device came in third place and quickly found success after hitting the market in 2022. After undergoing a few upgrades, vape detectors became the flagship product of his company Triton Sensors, which claims it offers “the most accurate sensor to detect Vape, THC, Loitering, Crowding, Keywords, Aggression, Gunshots and More.” There are thousands of them in campus bathrooms across the country, including in the nation's two largest school districts, New York City and Los Angeles.

But don't call Triton Sensors “vape detectors”: Parthemore said the label is “one of my pet peeves, honestly.” They're much more than that, he maintains. He called vape detection the company's “low-hanging fruit,” as it pursues a more ambitious goal of promoting safety in public bathrooms and other private spaces where cameras are prohibited and authorities “have no idea of really what's going on.”

He claimed Triton sensors allow school officials to know how many students are in the restrooms at any given time, even without a videofeed. With sensors that pick up 20 different environmental factors—from air quality to gunshots—Parthemore said they're able to capture “about 90 percent of what a camera can.”

“I can tell you where they're at in the room, I can tell you how long they've been there, so we can detect things like class cutting or overcrowding,” he said. A keyword detection feature allows the sensors to notify officials of an emergency. “If someone's in trouble, they can yell ‘help me,' or ‘stop it,' or ‘emergency.'”

Equipping the sensors with cameras, he said, is outside the equation and that the devices don't collect “any personally identifiable information,” so while they can zero in on how many students might be in a bathroom at any given time, they don't attempt to pinpoint individual students.

Yet as manufacturers like Triton and HALO branch out beyond flagging fragrant vape plumes, they raise additional privacy concerns. A massive vulnerability in the latest Motorola-owned HALO sensors, which include the microphones designed to alert school staff to fights, school shootings, and “aggression,” was exposed in August.

At a conference in Las Vegas, hackers revealed how the devices suffered from a flaw that allowed them to hijack the HALO sensors' microphones. Once that weakness was exploited, the duo were able to eavesdrop remotely and create fake alerts. Motorola responded almost immediately, notifying its customers it was rolling out updates after the sensors suffered “critical vulnerabilities” that allowed hackers to take control of the sensors “through brute-force attacks.”

It's this creeping surveillance that gives some students pause, even those who told The 74 they otherwise support vape detectors in bathrooms. The possibility of unknown capabilities with the sensors is “very scary to me” said Moledina, the Austin teen, who worries about a future where bathrooms come with cameras.

“Just knowing that there is vape smoke in the bathroom doesn't really help you because the administrators already know it's happening, and just by knowing that it's there isn't going to help them find out who is doing it,” he said. “So my concern is that, at the end of the day, we're going to end up having cameras in bathrooms, which is definitely not what we want.”

Minneapolis educators have used surveillance cameras in conjunction with the sensors to identify students for vaping in the bathrooms, discipline logs show.

In February, for example, a Roosevelt High School senior was suspended for a day based on accusations they hit a weed vape in the bathroom. Officials reviewed footage from a surveillance camera outside the bathroom and determined the student was “entering and exiting the bathroom during the timeframe that the detector went off.” They were searched, and administrators found “a marijuana vape, an empty glass jar with a weed smell and a baggie with weed shake in it.”

That same month, educators referred a Camden High School student to a drug and alcohol counselor for “vaping in the single stall bathrooms.”

“After I reviewed the camera it does show [a] student leaving out that same stall bathroom,” campus officials reported.

Gutierrez, the 18-year-old from Arizona, said she quit vaping after she was suspended and now copes with depression through positive means like painting. What she didn't do, however, was quit because she received help at school for the mental health challenges that led her to vape in the first place.

She stopped vaping while she was suspended, she said, because she was away from her friends and lacked access. She was frightened into further compliance, Gutierrez recalled, by the online lessons depicting vaping as a gross, gooey purple monster that would poison her relationships.

“Yes I stopped, but it wasn't a good stop,” she said. “I didn't get no support. I didn't get no counseling. I stopped because I was scared.”

Additive manufacturing methods could be addictive if they prove efficient

Apple has adopted additive manufacturing (or 3D printing) for making chassis for Apple Watches as well as USB-C port receptacles for the ultra-thin iPhone Air. The company is printing these components using titanium powder obtained from recycling, thus greatly reducing usage of materials while achieving its products' signature great looks and structural strength. This is the first time that Apple has applied additive manufacturing for a mass-market device.

To build chassis for Apple Watch Ultra 3, Apple Watch 11 titanium, and the USB-C receptacle of the iPhone Air, Apple uses a special powder-based laser process that fuses together fine titanium grains — each around 50 micrometers across and refined to keep oxygen levels low to avoid explosions during heating — layer by layer using a laser. To produce one watch chassis, the company says a metal 3D printer with one galvanometer housing six lasers makes 900 passes to craft numerous layers that are exactly 60 microns thick.

Once the printing run completes, the partially buried components must be cleaned and separated. Excess powder is first vacuumed away, then removed from pockets and channels using an ultrasonic shaker. Individual chassis are then freed from the build block by a thin wire that slices between them, while a coolant jet keeps temperatures low to prevent distortion. Finally, optical metrology checks dimensions and appearance to ensure the pieces meet the strict visual and structural tolerances required before they reach the assembly line.

Apple says that usage of this titanium powder-based 3D printing method allows it to cut titanium usage in half compared to earlier machining-based production methods, or by over 400 metric tons of raw metal in a single year.

Lots of companies use similar metal 3D-printing methods for titanium or other metals, but almost no company has done it at Apple's scale of millions of parts. The company says that adopting this technology required years of trial builds, material experiments, and validation runs. Apple also had to refine its titanium alloy recipe, calibrate the printing parameters, and ensure that surfaces produced this way match those made using forging and machining,

One advantage unlocked by this method is the ability to form intricate surfaces that traditional forging cannot reach. For the cellular versions of the watch, a textured interior pattern can now be printed directly into sections that interface with plastic components to enhance the seal and improve radio performance thanks to stronger bonding between metal and polymer.

Apple stresses that two Apple Watch chassis and the USB-C frame used in the iPhone Air are just the beginning for its use of additive manufacturing. The company sees more possibilities for 3D printing far beyond these first products, but it stresses that further adoption of the technology will require it to rethink how its future devices are designed and built.

Elon Musk attended a dinner Tuesday at the White House, held by President Donald Trump in honor of Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS). And it seems like we can officially call it. The public spat between Musk and Trump is done. For now.

How can anyone be sure the messiness between the two men is over? When President Trump entered the room with MBS, he gave Musk a pat on the stomach.

 

Trump gave a speech at the dinner, livestreamed by major media outlets, praising Saudi Arabia's pledge to invest $1 trillion in the U.S. The president also announced he was elevating the country to a “major non-NATO-ally,” which means the two countries will work on economic and military issues more closely.

Trump also gave a shout out to Nvidia and Apple CEO Tim Cook from the stage for “all of the money that you're investing in the United States.” The president didn't mention Musk in his speech, but who needs a shout-out when you've got yourself a belly pat.

The White House dinner landed on a particularly odd day, with the U.S. House of Representatives voting overwhelmingly Tuesday to release Department of Justice files on late sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. The House voted 427-1 in favor of releasing the files, with Rep. Clay Higgins, a Republican from Louisiana, as the lone vote against. Soon after, the Senate agreed to deem the legislation as passed without even a vote, and it's now on its way to President Donald Trump's desk for his signature.

It's unclear when Trump might sign the Epstein Files Transparency Act since he's a little busy tonight. But Musk's presence at the East Room event is amusing, given how the billionaire oligarch exited his formal role in government on May 30. Musk was the head of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) before he left in a bizarre spectacle witnessed by reporters in the Oval Office of the White House.

Musk's supposed “exit” from government was about personal relationships more than professional ones. SpaceX didn't lose any contracts, for example, but he did briefly lose the respect of the man he'd helped install at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. It started when Musk showed up to the White House on May 30, with a black eye and an awkward demeanor (Musk stared up at the ceiling at one point), though the two men tried to make it sound like they were parting ways amicably.

Musk spent the next few days tweeting his criticism of the Republicans' “Big Beautiful Bill,” arguing it didn't do enough to restrict spending. And Trump eventually started pushing back at Musk, explaining by June 5 that he must have “Trump Derangement Syndrome,” and ridiculing his black eye.

Later that day, Musk exploded on X, accusing Trump of being in the Epstein files. You don't need to take Musk's word for it, given the fact that reporting from the Wall Street Journal indicates Pam Bondi has told Trump he's in the files. The question is what being in the files actually means for Trump. The president's name was in many of the emails recently released by a House subcommittee investigating Epstein.

After Musk's public blow-up with Trump (he eventually deleted the tweets about Epstein), the billionaire pledged to start his own political party. Musk positioned his new party, dubbed the America Party, as something that would be more reasonable than the current Democratic and Republican parties. Musk, despite being a far-right kook, has often branded himself as a centrist in a world that's gone too “woke,” with suggestions that the Overton Window has shifted to only make it look like he's an extremist.

Not long after his falling out with Trump, Musk was asked on X where he would use his new political party to release the Epstein files, and he replied with an emoji reading “100.” However, Musk has let the idea for his party fizzle out completely. Perhaps Musk realized that third parties rarely make a dent in the U.S. system, which is designed to favor the two major parties. The best demonstration of this bias is the fact that Ross Perot won 19% of the popular vote in the 1992 presidential election and didn't receive a single Electoral College vote. The system is simply rigged against third parties.

Musk's expected arrival at the White House on Tuesday won't be his first physical brush with Trump since their messy break-up in June. The two men were seen talking at a memorial service for MAGA influencer Charlie Kirk in September. Members of DOGE are reportedly planning a party in Austin, Texas, this weekend to celebrate the thawing of Musk and Trump's relationship, according to the New York Times. Though it seems unclear whether Musk himself will show up for that one.

Other notable attendees of the dinner at the White House on Tuesday, according to the New York Times: Paramount CEO David Ellison, Chevron CEO Mike Wirth, Blackstone CEO Stephen A. Schwarzman, and General Motors CEO Mary Barra. The president's son Donald Trump Jr. is also slated to attend.

Musk is firmly back on the Trump train, no matter what he said in their months apart. The billionaire told allies back in August that he's worried a political party would siphon off Republican voters and hurt the Republicans in the upcoming midterm elections, according to the Wall Street Journal. It might seem weird for Musk to cozy up with Trump again after all that's happened with the Epstein files, but as Gizmodo has frequently argued, these guys need each other. They clearly dislike each other personally, but oligarchies make for strange bedfellows.

Trump has built a powerful political machine and he holds the keys to federal contracts in the world's wealthiest country. Musk is the world's wealthiest person and he needs those federal contracts to keep his empire afloat. They don't have to like hanging out together, but they have to work in tandem if they're going to build the world they both want to see. It's a world where they stay at the top in business and government. And it's a world where masked men round up tens of thousands of immigrants (and the occasional Native American) in a quest to make America more white.

No big business in the US acts in good faith so the fact they are cheering this on tells me to be suspect. My read of this is they want to juice returns / timelines by avoiding bureaucracy and the city / local residents will deal with the inevitable mess.

GOP would call this the deep state. Regulators and judges have been targets of modern GOP fascism.

It is a way for massive cable companies to bypass local government, and may make the overall network experience worse. It might put local ISPs out of business that have been serving their communities for years.

Apple joined Black Friday promotions this year with discounts across nearly its entire product lineup, which is a break from years of minimal holiday sales. The Mac mini with M4 chip stands among the best compact desktop computers available, and it is now sitting at $499 instead of the usual $599 price tag for the 256GB model. This pricing undercuts generic no-name mini PCs that populate Amazon's budget desktop category and makes Apple's premium hardware competitive on cost alone.

The M4 chip is the latest silicon generation from Apple on a Mac Mini, built on second-generation 3-nanometer process technology that delivers major performance improvements over the M2 generation. The 10-core CPU splits into 4 performance cores and 6 efficiency cores, automatically distributing workloads based on task demands. Performance cores handle intensive applications-like video editing, 3D rendering, or compiling code-at maximum speed.

The 10-core GPU pushes graphics performance that rivals dedicated entry-level graphics cards in Windows PCs. Video editing in Final Cut Pro or DaVinci Resolve stays smooth with multiple 4K streams, real-time color grading, and effects processing. Gaming performance covers most macOS-compatible titles at 1440p with high settings, though the Mac gaming library remains limited compared to Windows. Neural Engine integration adds 16 cores dedicated to AI processing for features like image upscaling, voice recognition and computational photography.

This unified memory architecture pools 16GB of RAM across CPU, GPU, and Neural Engine instead of splitting memory between system RAM and dedicated video memory. This design eliminates data transfer bottlenecks between components, improving performance in applications that heavily use both the CPU and GPU simultaneously. The 16GB capacity handles professional workflows including 4K video editing, photo libraries with thousands of RAW files, and developer environments with multiple virtual machines. Memory bandwidth rises to 120GB/s which is considerably quicker than the DDR4 or DDR5 system memory in comparable Windows desktops.

It includes 256GB of SSD storage which means fast read and write times-roughly 3,000 MB/s reads and around 2,500 MB/s writes. OS responsiveness remains instant, with apps launching in seconds rather than the minute-long waits traditional hard drives impose. The capacity handles the OS, core applications, and light document storage, though video editors and photographers will need external storage for large media libraries.

Thunderbolt 5 support arrives through three USB-C ports on the back panel, each capable of 80Gbps bidirectional bandwidth. You can connect multiple 6K displays, high-speed external storage arrays, or eGPU enclosures through these ports while maintaining full bandwidth for all connected devices. Two additional USB-C ports are placed on the front panel for easy access with frequently connected devices such as phones, external drives, or SD card readers. HDMI 2.1 output supports 8K at 60Hz or 4K at 240Hz, covering both productivity and high-refresh gaming scenarios.

macOS Sequoia brings with it optimization for Apple Silicon that significantly outperforms Intel-based Macs in performance and battery efficiency. The update happens at once on all supported devices, keeping security and feature parity intact, without any fragmentation like those in the Windows or Android ecosystems. The OS comes with pro-grade apps such as Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro and Xcode available on the Mac App Store.

For $499, you're getting flagship Apple Silicon performance for less than budget Windows mini PCs with less capable processors and integrated graphics. This 17% discount brings premium desktop computing into pricing territory usually reserved for compromised hardware with slower processors, less RAM, and mechanical storage.

Parents may have more influence than they realize when it comes to shaping their children's behavior, especially for those at higher genetic risk for conduct problems, according to Rutgers Health-led research. 

The study, published in Frontiers in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, found that consistent parental monitoring – meaning knowing where children are, who they're with, and what they're doing – can help offset genetic risk for developing behavior problems during adolescence. 

Conduct problems, which include aggression, antisocial behavior and rule-breaking, often begin in childhood and are among the most common reasons youth are referred for mental health services. These behaviors are linked to long-term challenges such as substance use, school difficulties and justice system involvement. 

While genetics contribute to why some children are more likely to develop conduct problems, this study shows that parenting really matters. High levels of parental monitoring appeared to buffer the influence of genetic risk – meaning that attentive, consistent parenting can make a measurable difference, even for children who are more vulnerable biologically."

The study used data from more than 4,000 adolescents ages 12 to 14 participating in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, a long-term research project based in the United Kingdom. Researchers examined how genetic predispositions for behavioral disinhibition – tendencies toward impulsivity and rule-breaking – interacted with parental monitoring to predict conduct problems. 

Researchers found adolescents with higher genetic risk for externalizing behaviors showed more conduct problems only when parental monitoring was low. When monitoring was high, genetic risk had a much smaller impact on behavior. 

"This is a hopeful message for parents," said Danielle Dick, director of the Rutgers Addiction Research Center based at Rutgers Brain Health Institute and the senior author of the study. "Genes are not destiny. The environment parents create – the structure, consistency and connection they provide – can play a powerful role in protecting youth at risk." 

The findings build on decades of work showing that family and environmental factors interact with genetics to shape child development. As noted in the scientific literature, only a small number of studies have tested polygenic score effects during early adolescence, making this analysis a notable contribution.

Researchers said the results highlight the importance of family-based prevention and early intervention programs. Strengthening parenting skills, especially around monitoring and communication, could help reduce the development of conduct problems and their long-term consequences. 

"Adolescence is a critical window for intervention," said Choi. "By supporting parents and helping them stay engaged, we can change trajectories for young people who might otherwise struggle." 

The study was co-authored by Rutgers researchers Genevieve Dash, Sally Kuo, Fazil Aliev, Holly Poore and Sarah Brislin.

Jennifer Munson, a cancer researcher at Virginia Tech's Fralin Biomedical Research Institute at VTC, has been awarded two new National Institutes of Health grants to advance greater understanding and improved treatment of a deadly brain cancer.

While the grants from the National Cancer Institute fund different projects, both involve identifying how the movement of fluid surrounding tumor cells contributes to the spread of glioblastoma, a deadly brain tumor, into neighboring brain areas, allowing the cancer to return after surgery or radiation.

Munson and her team are identifying how liquid called interstitial fluid moves between cells and possibly contributes to the spread of tumor cells into neighboring brain areas, allowing the cancer to return and spread after treatment with surgery or radiation.

One of the grants, a five-year, $2.6 million award, aims to study how fluid flow changes with treatment, and how focused ultrasound can be leveraged to better target and distribute therapy.

The other grant, a two-year, $411,000 award, supports a project to build a novel model of fluid-filled spaces that surround vessels in the brain and how they behave in health and during cancer treatment.

There are no effective therapies for glioblastoma, one of the most common types of adult primary brain tumors and one of the most lethal human cancers. New approaches to understanding how this cancer invades tissues and recurs, and better treatments and targeted methods, are desperately needed."

Jennifer Munson, professor, Fralin Biomedical Research Institute

With the two-year grant, Munson is teaming up with Malisa Sarntinoranont, professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Florida. The collaboration will combine the Munson lab's expertise in fluid flow and imaging with Sarntinoranont's advanced computational modeling to develop the first whole-brain model of flow in the fluid-filled spaces around certain arteries.

The goal is to gain insight into how underlying structures in the brain may contribute to flow the transport of cancer cells during tumor growth.

The study will employ advanced MRI techniques to generate dynamic imaging of fluid flow in healthy brains and preclinical models with tumors. The team will generate detailed maps of fluid flow and use the maps to build computational models of flow in tumor development in the whole brain.

The model can then be used to examine differences in flow during tumor development, and to test the impacts of the anti-inflammatory and commonly administered drug dexamethasone on glioblastoma tumor progression.

With the other grant, Munson proposes to leverage interstitial fluid flow in a novel way, to target, assess, and plan individual patient-specific glioblastoma treatment.

Munson's lab has previously developed imaging and analysis methods that predict where a tumor is likely to reappear after treatment.

Cheng-Chia "Fred" Wu, a radiation oncologist and cancer researcher at the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute, is using focus ultrasound to transiently open the blood brain barrier, which can keep cancer drugs from reaching tumors. Wu has labs in Roanoke and at the Children's National Research & Innovation Campus in Washington, D.C.

The labs will use mapping to identify the best focused ultrasound targets and work with Associate Professor Eli Vlaisavljevich and Research Associate Professor Adam Maxwell of Virginia Tech's Department of Biomedical Engineering and Mechanics to develop a more precise focused ultrasound system.

The study also aims to determine how fluid flow is affected by different therapies. It could serve as a biomarker for therapeutic efficacy. In addition, the researchers will work with Russell Rockne, associate professor at the City of Hope comprehensive cancer care center in California, to develop mathematical models to predict tumor progression and drug distribution in light of changes.

"This coupling of precision identification with precision equipment is a major translational leap for our research," said Munson, who also is director of the FBRI's Cancer Research Center - Roanoke. "By the end of our project, we expect to have a tool set and understanding of how fluid flow changes and predicts therapeutic responses and progression in this devastating and treatment-resistant cancer."

Munson also holds an appointment in the Department of Biomedical Engineering and Mechanics in Virginia Tech's College of Engineering.

An AI tool that can analyze abnormalities in the shape and form of blood cells, and with greater accuracy and reliability than human experts, could change the way conditions such as leukemia are diagnosed.

Researchers have created a system called CytoDiffusion that uses generative AI – the same type of technology behind image generators such as DALL-E – to study the shape and structure of blood cells.

Unlike many AI models, which are trained to simply recognize patterns, the researchers – led by the University of Cambridge, University College London and Queen Mary University of London – showed that CytoDiffusion could accurately identify a wide range of normal blood cell appearances and spot unusual or rare cells that may indicate disease. Their results are reported in the journal Nature Machine Intelligence.

Spotting subtle differences in blood cell size, shape and appearance is a cornerstone of diagnosing many blood disorders. But the task requires years of training, and even then, different doctors can disagree on difficult cases.

We've all got many different types of blood cells that have different properties and different roles within our body. White blood cells specialise in fighting infection, for example. But knowing what an unusual or diseased blood cell looks like under a microscope is an important part of diagnosing many diseases."

Simon Deltadahl from Cambridge's Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, study's first author

However, a typical blood 'smear' contains thousands of cells – far more than any human could analyse. "Humans can't look at all the cells in a smear – it's just not possible," said Deltadahl. "Our model can automate that process, triage the routine cases, and highlight anything unusual for human review."

"The clinical challenge I faced as a junior haematology doctor was that after a day of work, I would face a lot of blood films to analyse," said co-senior author Dr Suthesh Sivapalaratnam from Queen Mary University of London. "As I was analysing them in the late hours, I became convinced AI would do a better job than me."

To develop CytoDiffusion, the researchers trained the system on over half a million images of blood smears collected at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge. The dataset – the largest of its kind – included both common blood cell types and rarer examples, as well as elements that can confuse automated systems.

By modelling the full distribution of cell appearances rather than just learning to separate categories, the AI became more robust to differences between hospitals, microscopes and staining methods, and better able to recognise rare or abnormal cells.

In tests, CytoDiffusion could detect abnormal cells linked to leukemia with far greater sensitivity than existing systems. It also matched or surpassed current state-of-the-art models, even when given far few training examples; and quantify its own uncertainty.

"When we tested its accuracy, the system was slightly better than humans," said Deltadahl. "But where it really stood out was in knowing when it was uncertain. Our model would never say it was certain and then be wrong, but that is something that humans sometimes do."

"We evaluated our method against many of the challenges seen in real-world AI, such as never-before-seen images, images captured by different machines and the degree of uncertainty in the labels," said co-senior author Professor Michael Roberts, also from Cambridge's Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics. "This framework gives a multi-faceted view of model performance which we believe will be beneficial to researchers."

The team also showed that CytoDiffusion could generate synthetic blood cell images indistinguishable from real ones. In a 'Turing test' with ten experienced hematologists, the human experts were no better than chance at telling real from AI-generated images.

"That really surprised me," said Deltadahl. "These are people who stare at blood cells all day, and even they couldn't tell."

As part of the project, the researchers are releasing what they say is the world's largest publicly available dataset of peripheral blood smear images: more than half a million in total.

"By making this resource open, we hope to empower researchers worldwide to build and test new AI models, democratise access to high-quality medical data, and ultimately contribute to better patient care," said Deltadahl.

While the results are promising, the researchers say that CytoDiffusion is not a replacement for trained clinicians. Instead, it is designed to support them by rapidly flagging abnormal cases for review and handling more routine ones automatically.

"The true value of healthcare AI lies not in approximating human expertise at lower cost, but in enabling greater diagnostic, prognostic, and prescriptive power than either experts or simple statistical models can achieve," said co-senior author Professor Parashkev Nachev from UCL. "Our work suggests that generative AI will be central to this mission, transforming not only the fidelity of clinical support systems but their insight into the limits of their own knowledge. This 'metacognitive' awareness – knowing what one does not know – is critical to clinical decision-making, and here we show machines may be better at it than we are."

The researchers say further work is needed to make the system faster and to test it across diverse patient populations to ensure fairness and accuracy.

The research was supported in part by the Trinity Challenge, Wellcome, the British Heart Foundation, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Trust, Barts Health NHS Trust, the NIHR Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre, NIHR UCLH Biomedical Research Centre, and NHS Blood and Transplant. The research was conducted by the Imaging working group within the BloodCounts! consortium, which aims to use AI to improve blood diagnostics globally. Simon Deltadahl is a Member of Lucy Cavendish College, Cambridge.

Antibiotic resistance is one of the most pressing challenges to global public health as harmful microbes evolve to evade these medications. Now, researchers at University of California San Diego and their colleagues have developed a new method to combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria using bacteriophages, or phages, for short - viruses that infect and kill bacteria - as an alternative to traditional antibiotics. 

The researchers targeted Klebsiella pneumoniae, a species of bacteria notorious for its ability to resist multiple antibiotics. The dangerous pathogen can cause severe infections in hospital settings, including pneumonia and sepsis. While phages have been used as a treatment for bacterial infections for over a century, they are extremely specific about which strains of a bacterial species they will attack. This has limited their effectiveness against the most antibiotic-resistant strains.

To overcome this problem, the research team "trained" the phages by allowing them to evolve together with the bacteria in a controlled laboratory setting for 30 days. 

This technique, called "experimental evolution", permitted the phages to adapt to bacterial defenses. This resulted in significant improvements to their ability to kill a wide variety of bacterial strains, including multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant K. pneumoniae - strains that pose a significant challenge to modern medicine.

What's more, the evolved phages also demonstrated an enhanced ability to suppress bacterial growth over extended periods of time. 

Genetic analysis revealed that the evolved phages acquired mutations to specific genes responsible for recognizing and binding to bacterial cells to initiate the infection process. These changes likely contributed to their improved effectiveness. 

The research, led by senior author David T. Pride, M.D., Ph.D., professor of pathology at UC San Diego School of Medicine, highlights the potential of phage therapy as a powerful tool to address the global antibiotic resistance crisis. The team believes their method could be adapted to target other resistant pathogens, offering an avenue for developing treatments against a wide range of life-threatening infections.

The study was published in Nature Communications on November 19, 2025.

Berenson Cancer Center published survival data analyzed by the Institute for Myeloma & Bone Cancer Research of 175 consecutive and unselected patients with multiple myeloma in the journal Haematologica.

All patients with multiple myeloma who started their treatment from 2006 to 2024 at Berenson Cancer Center, a clinic that specializes in the treatment of patients with this common form of bone marrow-based cancer, were included in the study.

Study authors report an average survival of nearly 13 years which is the longest reported to date in any unselected group of multiple myeloma patients.

Unlike other myeloma centers which consider stem cell transplant as a standard part of the initial therapy for these patients, none of the patients underwent this as their first treatment and only one patient after that. Moreover, no patient was treated with CAR T-cell therapy or bispecific antibodies. Notably, the unprecedented outcomes in this study were achieved without use of any of these treatments.

Nearly 40,000 Americans are expected to be diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 2025 and 200,000 are living with this cancer.

The highly individualized care multiple myeloma patients receive includes more treatment options than used anywhere in the world. Patients also have 24-hour direct access to the treating physician. Importantly, more frequent regular monitoring of the patient's disease status allows for more rapid changes in treatments that are not working or causing unwanted side effects. Together, these benefits have resulted in unprecedented outcomes for myeloma patients."

James R. Berenson, M.D., Study Senior Author, President & Medical Director, Berenson Cancer Center

Dr. Berenson has over 40 years of "hands-on" experience taking care of multiple myeloma patients which he believes has led to the identification of more effective treatments and expertise in using therapies to achieve the best possible outcomes for his patients.

A new scientific review reveals the molecular networks underlying coffee's most potent compounds, demonstrating how this everyday drink may reduce disease risks through its coordinated antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects.

Scientists have conducted a systematic review to establish a molecular-theoretical foundation for repositioning coffee as a targeted nutritional intervention rather than an empirical beverage. The results are published in Frontiers of Nutrition. 

Coffee is a popular beverage derived from the processed fruits of the Coffea species. Scientists have traced the use of coffee back to 15th-century Yemeni Sufi monasteries, and highlight its relevance within the concept of “food–medicine homology,” where foods possess both nutritional and medicinal functions.

The global coffee industry continues to exhibit robust growth, with annual coffee bean production exceeding 10 million metric tons. Commercial coffee cultivation predominantly involves Coffea arabica L. (Arabica), Coffea liberica Hiern (Liberica), and Coffea canephora Pierre ex A. Froehner (Robusta). Arabica accounts for approximately 70% of the global market share, primarily because of its low bitterness and complex aromatic profile.

Multiple studies have described coffee as a chemically complex beverage rich in bioactive compounds. Raw (unroasted) coffee beans mainly contain carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. It also includes a minimal quantity of nitrogenous compounds, minerals, and acid-ester substances.

The process of roasting coffee beans also produces several compounds, such as melanoidins, driven by Maillard reactions and pyrolysis. For instance, the content of carbohydrates and nitrogenous compounds decreases, while the lipid content increases after roasting. Notably, melanoidins formed during roasting may constitute up to one-quarter of the roasted bean mass, reflecting extensive chemical transformation.

Scientists have broadly classified the bioactive compounds of coffee into four major categories, namely, alkaloids (e.g., caffeine, trigonelline), polyphenols (e.g., chlorogenic acids), diterpenes (e.g., cafestol), and Maillard reaction products (melanoidins). These compounds interact through synergistic and antagonistic mechanisms, forming multidimensional regulatory networks that lead to diverse health benefits.

It is emphasized that understanding these network-level interactions is essential, as focusing on isolated compounds does not accurately reflect how coffee behaves under real consumption conditions.

The mechanisms associated with the bioactive compounds in coffee and their therapeutic effects are described below.

Caffeine, a methylxanthine derivative, is a highly stable alkaloid that is primarily metabolized in the liver through P450 1A2 (CYP1A2). This alkaloid primarily derives its physiological functions from competitive antagonism of adenosine A1/A2A receptors and specific inhibition of phosphodiesterase 4/5 (PDE4/5) activity. Through these mechanisms, caffeine acts as a low-affinity benzodiazepine-site antagonist at γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA_A) receptors that play a crucial role in reducing seizure threshold.

Molecular studies have demonstrated caffeine's neuroprotective role. It acts as a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant, potentially enhancing cognitive function and reducing the risk of Parkinson's disease (PD) through antagonism of the adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR). However, increased caffeine intake may increase sleep disturbances and anxiety.  

Multiple studies have demonstrated the anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, anti-obesity, and anti-diabetic effects of caffeine. The review also cites human cohort evidence showing that caffeinated coffee, rather than decaffeinated coffee, is strongly associated with a reduced risk of neurodegenerative disease.

Several in vitro studies, animal models, and molecular docking analyses have demonstrated the potential of trigonelline for neurodegenerative disorders, including AD, PD, and depression, through mechanisms that include oxidative stress mitigation, acetylcholine inhibition, and neuroinflammatory suppression.

Chlorogenic acids (CGAs) are hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives, which are the most abundantly found polyphenols in coffee. These polyphenols are key contributors to coffee's antioxidant and metabolic regulatory properties. Mechanistically, 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid (5-CQA), an abundantly found CGA, activates the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway to suppress oxidative stress and inhibits α-glucosidase to modulate postprandial glycemia.

A typical coffee serving contains approximately 27 to 121mg of CGAs. These bioactive compounds are associated with glycemic regulation, anti-inflammatory actions, and neuroprotection. Roasting significantly degrades CGAs, with light roasting retaining far more CGAs than dark roasting.

Cafestol and kahweol are furan diterpenes that are abundantly found in coffee oils. Their physiological effects largely depend on the brewing methods. For instance, paper-filtered techniques remove a significant amount of diterpenoids, whereas unfiltered brewing techniques, such as the French press, retain the full content.

Diterpenes exhibit paradoxical biological activities. It triggers an increase in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, potentially elevating the risk of cardiovascular disease, and induces glutathione S-transferase (GST) for anticancer activity.  Diterpenes also exhibit hepatoprotective and anti-inflammatory properties.

During coffee roasting, the Maillard reaction produces a complex array of compounds, including melanoidins. These compounds exhibit furan and pyrrole ring-enriched molecular structures, responsible for their metal ion chelation capacity and lipid peroxidation inhibitory activity.

However, the Maillard reaction also leads to the production of harmful compounds, such as acrylamide, a Group 2A carcinogen. Higher acrylamide concentration has been found in dark-roasted coffee, which exhibits neurotoxic and carcinogenic effects.

Although acrylamide levels can be measurable, typical dietary exposure from coffee remains below most regulatory concern thresholds.

Coffee contains a variety of chemical compounds that work together, oppose each other, or act in sequence to affect multiple molecular targets. Through these interactions, coffee helps regulate oxidative stress, inflammation, metabolism, and neuroprotection. Extensive epidemiological evidence links moderate coffee consumption with lower risks of type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and cardiovascular disorders.

Current pharmacological research on coffee is often fragmented, focusing on isolated components and overlooking interactions among multiple compounds. This results in three major research limitations: an overemphasis on isolated compounds rather than multicomponent synergy, a limited investigation of minor bioactive constituents, and an overreliance on in vitro or rodent models that lack human translational validation.

By mapping the target networks of CGAs, caffeine, and related compounds, researchers will be able to clarify the biological basis of coffee's multi-target regulation. This integrated approach would support a more holistic view of coffee as a functional food and provide a theoretical foundation for its health benefits.

A recent study in Finland found that among people aged at least 70 years with rosacea, fewer than 10% were diagnosed before enrollment. Because of rosacea's burden and its association with potentially serious comorbidities in this age group, the authors said, older patients would benefit from increased awareness of rosacea among providers and better access to dermatologic care.

For the retrospective cross-sectional study, Laura Huilaja, MD, PhD, and Suvi-Päivikki Sinikumpu, MD, PhD, of the University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland, invited local parents of participants in the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 to undergo a skin examination performed by a dermatologist and to complete a health-related questionnaire. Investigators also searched participants' electronic health records for any rosacea diagnosis between 1996 and 2018.

Of 1306 participants living in the Oulu area, 552 (42.3%; mean age, 78.4 years; range, 70-93 years) underwent total body skin examination and were included in the study, which was published in April 2025 in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society. Skin examinations revealed rosacea in 137 participants (24.8%), but only 10 of these patients (7.3%) reported a previous rosacea diagnosis. Investigators also found the diagnosis in the health records of another three patients (2.2%). Among the 415 participants without rosacea upon examination, the proportions who reported a history of rosacea or had hospital records thereof were 9 (2.2%) and 2 (0.5%), respectively.

Potential reasons for the underdiagnosis of rosacea included poor symptom recognition, the authors wrote. “Visible signs such as redness or telangiectasias are often interpreted as normal signs of aging or ignored as just a cosmetic nuisance,” they explained. Additional reasons may have included time constraints in primary care, limited rosacea awareness among such providers, and patients' unwillingness to seek treatment due to the stigma of rosacea, the authors surmised.

Recognizing rosacea in older patients is important, the investigators wrote, because its prevalence rises with age, peaking in men after 70 years, and the risks of strongly associated comorbidities such as Parkinson's disease, cardiovascular and gastric diseases, metabolic syndrome, depression, and anxiety also increase with age.

Jonathan S. Weiss, MD, said that study findings closely mirrored what he sees among older patients in his practice. Among patients aged 60 years or older, he said, “You see a fair amount of rosacea, and many of them have never had it before.” Weiss is an adjunct assistant professor of dermatology at Emory University, Atlanta. He was not involved with the study but was asked to comment on the findings.

The fact that around two thirds of study patients had erythematotelangiectatic rosacea also matches what Weiss sees clinically among older patients. “And there's not a ton you can do medically for erythematotelangiectatic rosacea,” he told Medscape Medical News. Patients hear about rosacea treatments, he explained, “and they don't realize that there are not simple medical treatments for erythematotelangiectatic rosacea, though there are procedural therapies. So they come in with perhaps unrealistic expectations.”

For background erythema, he said, patients in the US are usually satisfied with topical brimonidine (Mirvaso) or topical oxymetazoline (Rhofade). And papulopustular rosacea responds very well to various tetracycline formulations, particularly doxycycline, added Weiss.

American physicians also can consider new low-dose, time-release oral minocycline (Emrosi), Weiss added, although patients are often surprised to learn that branded drugs are difficult to get covered by Medicare. The same can be true for extended-release doxycycline (Oracea), he told Medscape Medical News, although less so because generic alternatives exist. Additionally, Medicare rules exclude devices such as lasers and electrocautery, which he said are among the few effective treatments for telangiectasias, as medically unnecessary.

Study limitations include its failure to address advanced rosacea subtypes such as phymatous rosacea, said Weiss. Additionally, the authors acknowledged that their findings cannot be generalized beyond the White population. Many older patients — especially those with skin of color — may have less access to dermatologists, Weiss pointed out.

The study will have little impact on dermatology, he added, except perhaps to remind dermatologists to exercise caution regarding drug-drug interactions in older patients.

Non-dermatologists should be aware that rosacea can arise without a prior history in older patients, said Weiss. Raising awareness of this possibility among general internists and family practitioners assumes increased importance, he noted, because rosacea also can affect the eyes, with a potentially serious impact on vision. Therefore, he recommended that primary care providers always ask patients with skin symptoms of rosacea about ocular manifestations such as dry eye and treat ocular symptoms if present.

Altogether, the study “underlines the need for increased awareness and education about rosacea among both older patients and healthcare professionals,” wrote Huilaja, Sinikumpu, and colleagues. Improvements in diagnostic protocols and better access to dermatologists, they added, “could help reduce the degree of underdiagnosis and, thereby, could ease the burden of rosacea among older people.”

The study authors reported receiving no funding sources and having no conflicts of interest. Weiss reported being a researcher, consultant, and/or speaker for AbbVie; Arcutis Biotherapeutics; Aslan; Bausch; Biofrontera AG; Bristol Myers Squibb; Cutera, Inc.; Dermavant/Organon; Galderma; Incyte; LEO Pharma; Novartis; Ortho; Pfizer; Regeneron; Sanofi; Sun Pharma; UCB; and Verrica Pharmaceuticals.

The increase of UPFs in diets worldwide presents an urgent challenge to health that demands coordinated policies and advocacy action to address, says a new three paper Series authored by 43 global experts and published in The Lancet. The Series exposes the tactics UPF companies use to drive consumption and prevent effective policy. It outlines a roadmap for change towards impactful government regulation, community mobilization, and accessible and affordable healthier diets.

The growing consumption of ultra-processed foods is reshaping diets worldwide, displacing fresh and minimally processed foods and meals. This change in what people eat is fuelled by powerful global corporations who generate huge profits by prioritizing ultra-processed products, supported by extensive marketing and political lobbying to stop effective public health policies to support healthy eating."

Professor Carlos Monteiro, University of Sao Paulo, Brazil

Professor Camila Corvalan, University of Chile, Chile, adds, "Addressing this challenge requires governments to step up and introduce bold, coordinated policy action - from including markers of UPFs in front-of-package labels to restricting marketing and implementing taxes on these products to fund greater access to affordable, nutritious foods."

Dr Phillip Baker, University of Sydney, Australia, adds, "We need a strong global public health response - like the coordinated efforts to challenge the tobacco industry. Including safeguarding policy spaces from political lobbying and building powerful coalitions to advocate for healthy, fair and sustainable food systems and stand-up to corporate power."

UPFs, as defined by the Nova classification, are novel branded products made from inexpensive industrial ingredients such as hydrogenated oils, protein isolates or glucose/fructose syrup, and cosmetic food additives (e.g. dyes, artificial sweeteners, emulsifiers). They are designed and marketed to displace fresh and minimally processed foods and traditional meals, while maximising corporate profits.

The first paper in the new Lancet Series reviews the scientific evidence on UPFs and health, since the Nova classification was developed by Prof Carlos Monteiro and team in 2009. The Series presents consistent evidence that UPFs are displacing long-established dietary patterns, worsening diet quality, and are associated with an increased risk of multiple chronic diet-related diseases.

Several national surveys indicate the share of UPFs in diets is on the rise (paper 1, figure 1): estimated energy contribution of UPFs to total household food purchases or daily food intake tripled in Spain (11% to 32%) and China (4% to 10%) over the last three decades, and increased (10% to 23%) in Mexico and Brazil over the previous four decades. In the USA and UK, it increased slightly over the last two decades, maintaining levels above 50%.

Evidence reviewed in the Series shows that diets high in UPFs are linked to overeating, poor nutritional quality (too much sugar and unhealthy fats, and too little fibre and protein) and higher exposure to harmful chemicals and additives. Additionally, a systematic review conducted for the Series, encompassing 104 long-term studies, found 92 reported greater associated risks of one or more chronic diseases, with meta-analyses showing significant associations for 12 health conditions, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, depression, and early death from all causes.

The Series authors acknowledge valid scientific critiques of Nova and UPFs - such as lack of long-term clinical and community trials, an emerging understanding of mechanisms, and the existence of subgroups with different nutritional values - as key areas for future research (paper 1, panel 3). However, they argue future research must not delay immediate and decisive public health action justified by the current evidence.

Professor Mathilde Touvier, French National Institute for Health and Medical Research (Inserm), France, says, "While healthy debate about UPFs within the scientific community is welcomed, this should be distinguished from attempts by vested interests to undermine the current evidence. The growing body of research suggests diets high in ultra-processed foods are harming health globally and justifies the need for policy action."

The second paper in the Series outlines coordinated policies to regulate and reduce UPF production, marketing, and consumption, to hold large companies accountable for their role in promoting unhealthy diets.

The paper sets out how improving diets worldwide requires specific UPF policies to complement existing legislation to reduce high fat, salt and sugar (HFSS) content in foods.

Professor Barry Popkin, University of North Carolina, US, says "We call for including ingredients that are markers of UPFs (eg, colours, flavours, and sweeteners) in front-of-package labels, alongside excessive saturated fat, sugar, and salt, to prevent unhealthy ingredient substitutions, and enable more effective regulation."

The authors propose stronger marketing restrictions - especially for adverts directed at children, on digital media, and at the brand level - as well as banning UPFs in public institutions such as schools and hospitals and placing limits on UPFs sales and shelve space in supermarkets. One success story is Brazil's national school feeding program which has eliminated most UPFs and will require 90% of the food to be fresh or minimally processed food by 2026.

Authors emphasize that alongside regulating UPFs, policies must expand access to fresh foods. This could be achieved by taxing selected UPFs to fund fresh food subsidies for low-income households.

Professor Marion Nestle, New York University, US, says, "Improving diets worldwide requires policies tailored to each country's unique situation and how entrenched UPFs have become in people's daily eating habits. While priorities may differ, urgent action is needed everywhere to regulate ultra-processed foods alongside existing efforts to reduce high fat, salt, and sugar content".

Associate Professor Gyorgy Scrinis, University of Melbourne, Australia, adds, "Importantly, policies must ensure that fresh and minimally processed foods are accessible and affordable - not just for those with time to cook, but for busy families and individuals who rely on convenient options. Only by combining stricter regulation on poor quality food products with realistic support for more nutritious choices can we truly promote better diets for all."

The third paper in the Series explains how global corporations, not individual choices, are driving the rise of UPFs, and that a global health response to this challenge is urgent and feasible.

Authors highlight how UPF companies use cheap ingredients and industrial methods to cut costs, paired with aggressive marketing and appealing designs to boost consumption.

With global annual sales of $1.9 trillion, UPFs are the most profitable food sector. UPF manufacturers alone account for over half of $2.9 trillion in shareholder payouts by all publicly listed food companies since 1962. These profits fuel growing corporate power in food systems, by resourcing UPF companies to expand production, marketing, and political influence, thereby reshaping diets worldwide.

The Series reveals how UPF companies employ sophisticated political tactics to protect profits - blocking regulations, shaping scientific debates, and influencing public opinion. They coordinate hundreds of interest groups worldwide, lobby politicians, make political donations and engage in litigation to delay policies.

Professor Simon Barquera, the National Institute of Public Health of Mexico, Mexico, says "Powerful corporations – not individuals' choices – are behind the global rise of ultra-processed foods. Through interest groups, these corporations often position themselves as part of the solution, but their actions tell a different story – one focused on protecting profits and resisting effective regulation."

The authors call for a coordinated global public health response to protect policymaking from industry interference, end industry ties with health professionals and organisations, and build a global UPFs action advocacy network.

Professor Karen Hoffman, University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa, adds "Just as we confronted the tobacco industry decades ago, we need a bold, coordinated global response now to curb the overproportionate power of UPF corporations and build food systems that prioritise people's health and wellbeing."

The Series says tackling UPFs must involve a different vision for our food systems – creating systems that support diverse local food producers, preserve cultural food traditions, promote gender equity, and ensuring the economic benefits of food production flow back to communities rather than shareholders.

Dr Phillip Baker, continues, "We are currently living in a world where our food options are increasingly dominated by UPFs, contributing to rising global levels of obesity, diabetes and mental ill-health. Our Series highlights that a different path is possible - one where governments regulate effectively, communities mobilize, and healthier diets are accessible and affordable for all."

The Latest | Nov 19, 2025

KANSAS CITY (Nov. 19, 2025) — Kansas City Current midfielder Ally Sentnor has been called up for the United States Under-23 Women's National Team for the upcoming FIFA international window. U.S. Soccer announced its 20-player roster for a pair of overseas friendlies on Wednesday.

Players born in 2002 or later are age-eligible for this year's U-23 Women's National Team. The U-23 matches are another step in U.S. Women's National Team (USWNT) head coach Emma Hayes' emphasis on this age group and its importance along the player pathway.

The U.S. will first travel to Senec, Slovakia, for a unique opportunity for the U-23 squad to play against a senior national team. The Stars and Stripes will face the Slovakia Women's National Team at its national training center on Friday, Nov. 28. The U-23s will then travel to Accrington, England, where they will square off with the England U-23 Women's National Team on Monday, Dec. 1, at Wham Stadium.

No stranger to the USWNT system, Sentnor earned her first senior team cap in front of over 78,000 fans at Wembley Stadium against England on Nov. 30, 2024. Her first USWNT goal came in the opening match of the 2025 SheBelieves Cup against Colombia on Feb. 20 in what was her first start and third cap, becoming the first U.S. player to score her first USWNT goal in the SheBelieves Cup Tournament. Sentnor's first senior team assist was on KC Current forward Michelle Cooper's goal in the second match of the SheBelieves Cup vs. Australia three days later. She then capped off the event by scoring in the final SheBelieves Cup game against Japan on Feb. 26, and her first brace in a U.S. uniform was in a friendly with Jamaica on June 3.

A native of Hanson, Mass., Sentnor was named the 2024 U.S. Soccer Young Female Player of the Year a month prior to her SheBelieves Cup breakthrough.

Sentnor represented the Stars and Stripes at nearly every youth level as one of the most decorated U.S. Youth National Team players in history, including at the Under-20 level before her senior team berth. She captained the U.S. squad which earned bronze at the 2024 FIFA U-20 World Cup where she took home the Bronze Ball as the tournament's third-best player for scoring three goals. Sentnor, who co-captained the team at the 2024 U-20 Concacaf Championship, led the roster with four goals and two assists as the USA finished runner-up to secure the World Cup berth. She was also one of the youngest players on the U.S. roster at the 2022 FIFA U-20 World Cup, and she helped the U-20 team win the 2022 Sud Ladies Cup.

ATLANTA (Nov. 19, 2025) – Twenty players have been called up to the U.S. Under-23 Women's National Team by new head coach Heather Dyche for a training camp and matches in Europe running from Nov. 22 to Dec. 1 that will feature a game against the full Women's National Team of Slovakia and the England U-23 WNT.

These U-23 matches are another step in U.S. Women's National Team head coach Emma Hayes' emphasis on this age group and its importance along the player pathway to the full National Team. 

Goalkeepers (2): Liz Beardsley (Houston Dash; Lakeland, Fla.), Neeku Purcell (Seattle Reign; Seattle, Wash.)

Defenders (5): Eva Gaetino (Paris Saint-Germain FC, FRA; Dexter, Mich.), Ayo Oke (CF Pachuca, MEX; Lawrenceville, Ga.), Jayden Perry (Portland Thorns FC; Rancho Santa Margarita, Calif.), Evelyn Shores (Angel City FC; Atlanta, Ga.), Gisele Thompson (Angel City FC; Studio City, Calif.)

Midfielders (7): Kimmi Ascanio (San Diego Wave; Doral, Fla.), Abi Brighton (Juventus FC, ITA; Beaufort, S.C.), Riley Jackson (North Carolina Courage; Roswell, Ga.), Simone Jackson (Orlando Pride; Redondo Beach, Calif.), Ally Lemos (Orlando Pride; Glendora, Calif.), Sarah Schupansky (Gotham FC; Pittsburgh, Pa.), Ally Sentnor (Kansas City Current; Hanson, Mass.)

Forwards (6): Emeri Adames (Seattle Reign; Red Oak, Texas), Maddie Dahlien (Seattle Reign; Edina, Minn.), Karlie Lema (Bay FC; Morgan Hill, Calif.), Riley Tiernan (Angel City FC; Voorhees, N.J.), Pietra Tordin (Portland Thorns FC; Miami, Fla.), Sarah Weber (Racing Louisville FC; Gretna, Neb.)

“As Emma has been saying since she took over the National Team, getting meaningful international competition for this age group is invaluable,” Said Dyche. “Almost all of the NWSL players on this roster got quality minutes for their clubs this season, as have the players based at clubs outside the U.S., so we're looking forward to seeing them together in matches against European teams while dealing with the long travel. These are ideal situations for players to continue their growth.”

This will be the fifth and final U-23 WNT training camp of 2025, following domestic camps in Los Angeles, Denver and Philadelphia and an international trip to Germany during the summer. Hayes also held a “Futures Camp” last January alongside the USWNT in Florida. These will be Dyche's first international matches as head coach.

The USA will first travel to Senec, Slovakia, an eastern suburb of the capital of Bratislava, for a rare match for the U-23s against a senior National Team. The USA will face the Slovakia WNT at its National Training Center on Nov. 28. The USA will then travel to England where it will face the England U-23 WNT on Dec. 1 at Wham Stadium, a small venue in Accrington.

Players born in 2002 or later are age-eligible for this year's U-23 WNT, and the roster features players from six birth years ranging from 2002 to 2006, along with one born in 2008. Dyche called up three players born in 2002, eight born in 2003, five born in 2004, two born in 2005 and one in 2006. Seventeen-year-old San Diego Wave midfielder Kimmi Ascanio, who was born in 2008 and was age-eligible for this year's FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup but did not play in that tournament, gets her first call-up to the U.S. U-23s.

SAN JOSE, Calif. (Nov. 19, 2025) – U.S. Soccer announced today that Bay FC forward Karlie Lema has been selected to join the U.S. Under-23 Women's National Team for training and matches in Europe during the upcoming international window. The Cal product and Morgan Hill native will join the U-23 squad as it travels for friendly contests vs. the Slovakia senior national team and England U-23 Women's National Team.  

Lema joins the U-23 roster for the second time in 2025 after participating in the squad's October camp in Philadelphia. Her October invite marked her first to a national team program since joining the U-17 Women's National Team in February 2020. During her youth career, she represented the U-17 squad at the 2019 UEFA Development Tournament and the U-15 team at the 2018 CFA International Tournament in China prior to her collegiate career at Cal. With Bay FC this season, Lema recorded two goals and one assist in 24 games (15 starts).  



Led by new head coach Heather Dyche, next week's trip will mark the final U-23 WNT camp of 2025. The squad will visit Senec, Slovakia Nov. 28 to take on Slovakia at its national training center, a rare opportunity for the U-23 team to take on a senior national team. Following the match, the squad will travel to Wham Stadium in Accrington, England to face the England U-23 WNT on Dec. 1.  

Lema is one of 20 players selected to the roster, of which 17 players represent NWSL clubs. Players born in 2002 or later are age-eligible for this year's U-23 WNT, and the roster features players from six birth years ranging from 2002 to 2006, along with one born in 2008. Dyche called up three players born in 2002, eight born in 2003, five born in 2004, two born in 2005 and one in 2006. Seventeen-year-old San Diego Wave midfielder Kimmi Ascanio, who was born in 2008 and was age-eligible for this year's FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup but did not play in that tournament, gets her first call-up to the U.S. U-23s.

The USA have leapfrogged Mexico to restore their status as CONCACAF's top side, at least on the FIFA Men's World Rankings, which have also confirmed advantageous seeding for the Democratic Republic of Congo and Iraq, who will get a bye to the finals of the World Cup's inter-confederation playoffs.

Impressive victories over Paraguay and Uruguay saw Mauricio Pochettino's side surge to 14th in the rankings, their highest spot since the eve of the 2024 Copa America. Rising two places saw the USMNT bypass the opponent they beat in such emphatic fashion in Tampa, Fla. as well as Mexico, whose preparations for the World Cup were hindered by a defeat to and draw with the same opponents their CONCACAF rivals faced. The 1682 points they currently have is also the most any U.S. side have held in the near 33-year history of the rankings.

Meanwhile, a win for Brazil over Senegal in London and subsequent draw with Tunisia were enough to take Carlo Ancelotti's side over the Netherlands and Portugal and into fifth place. They do, however, trail by some distance the quartet who arguably rank as favorites for the World Cup: leaders Spain, Argentina, France and England. 

All seven aforementioned teams are set to be top seeds for the World Cup group phase when the draw is made in Washington D.C. on Dec. 5. They will be joined by Belgium and Germany, whose wins over Slovakia and Luxembourg were enough to hold off Croatia and earn ninth place in the rankings.

That had previously been occupied by Italy, whose hopes of benefitting from their lofty standings faded with a crushing home defeat to Norway in the final round of qualifiers. They must now book their World Cup spot through the European playoff round. It remains to be confirmed by FIFA but any team that does qualify through that path is expected to be placed in Pot Four.

Rounding out the top seeds are hosts USA, Mexico and Canada.

Lower down the rankings, DR Congo (56th) and Iraq (58th) find themselves assured of berths in the finals of the inter-confederation playoffs, which see six teams from outside Europe battle for two places at the World Cup. The unseeded teams, who must win a semifinal and final to advance, are Jamaica (70th), Bolivia (76th), Suriname (123rd) and New Caledonia (149th). The draws for both the inter-continental and European playoffs will be made in Zurich on Thursday, with games in the former competition to be held in Guadalajara and Monterrey.

The rankings reflected the dramatic scenes in qualifying games across the world in recent days. No team dropped more points than Denmark, pipped to a World Cup berth by Scotland in stunning fashion on Wednesday, while Republic of Ireland accrued the most thanks to their equally dramatic wins over Portugal and Hungary. Meanwhile Haiti climbed four places after beating Nicaragua and Costa Rica to qualify.

Alex Muzio, the chairman of the Union of European Clubs (UEC), a body representing  mid-sized and smaller clubs on the continent, has called out FIFA for failing to distribute the $250 million solidarity payment promised from last summer's inaugural 32-team Club World Cup.

In his speech at the UEC's Forum in Brussels, Belgium, Muzio highlighted FIFA's inaction: “The Club World Cup participants received their prize money - otherwise they would have probably not turned up as you may have noted from the conversations around Real Madrid at the time. But the solidarity money? Haven't heard anything about it. It's on to the next topic to distract, I guess - maybe a peace prize, maybe at the next FIFA press conference, which may come at the next Club World Cup?”

“The Club World Cup hit the full house on the bingo card of terrible governance: wild-card team added on a whim because Lionel Messi plays for them, calendar trampled on without any real consultation, dynamic pricing and ticketing, the cartel clubs distancing themselves from the rest. Mythical promises about solidarity.”

FIFA did not respond to a request for comment for this article.

In the build-up to the Club World Cup, FIFA announced a solidarity mechanism with a target of an extra $250 million for non-participant clubs across the world. The solidarity program was to assuage fears that the tournament's excessive prize money of $1 billion would further distort competitive balance.

That prize money was not shared equally but distributed according to a participation-success distribution key, ensuring that Europe's biggest clubs benefited the most. Real Madrid, Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain all made the semi-finals. The Athletic calculated that $623.1 million of the $1 billion wound up in the hands of 12 European clubs. Stakeholders in the European game were alarmed. The European Leagues, representing 35 domestic leagues, pointed to huge “polarization”. 

The gap between FIFA's promises and the lack of action exposes an accountability issue, according to the UEC.

Former Everton player and UEC CEO, Gareth Farrelly, says: “At the time, people were questioning whether that was a realistic figure or whether that would be the final amount. And it never materialized. So it's used as a justification with regard to how successful it was. But just for those non-participating clubs globally, I don't believe anyone's gotten a check yet. Have you?”

In a recent letter to The Guardian, FIFA's media director Bryan Swanson, defending FIFA's decision to establish a peace prize, wrote that “The revenue it generates is reinvested in football, and all 211 member associations benefit from the commercial success of the Fifa World Cup.”

Farrelly said: “The point is that there are never any questions asked.”

FIFA boss Gianni Infantino has always claimed that his organization has been reformed, but Muzio believes that a decade after FIFAgate, the global governing body is lacking, more than ever, the slightest form of good governance. He explained: “There are no more votes, just votes by acclamation, there is no more engagement. There is no interaction. FIFA is really going beyond the pale in terms of interaction, transparency, and governance. It's pretty clear that FIFA governance has somehow worsened in the last ten years, which is coming from the lowest possible bar.”

The top-seeded teams for the Dec. 5 World Cup tournament draw were set Wednesday when FIFA published new rankings the day after the direct qualifying rounds for next summer's marquee tournament concluded.

Co-hosts the United States, Canada and Mexico will be joined in the pot of No. 1 seeds by top-ranked Spain, defending champion Argentina, France, England, Portugal, Brazil, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany.

Croatia, a semifinalist in 2022 and beaten finalist by France in 2018, was brought down into pot 2 for the draw ceremony at the Kennedy Center in Washington DC. President Donald Trump is scheduled to attend.

The updated FIFA rankings also decided seeding for the draw Thursday for playoff brackets in March that will decide the final six entries in the expanded 48-nation lineup.

The 22 playoffs teams include 16 in Europe playing for four World Cup places and six from the other regions chasing two spots in the intercontinental brackets.

Italy is the headliner in the European brackets as the four-time world champion aims to avoid a humiliating third straight exit in the playoffs.

The 12th-ranked Italians were pushed into the playoffs after finishing runner-up in a qualifying group won by Norway. Erling Haaland's Norwegian team shapes as a dangerous option from pot 3 in two weeks' time.

Italy will be drawn Thursday at home against a fourth-seeded team. It could again be North Macedonia, which shockingly eliminated the Italians in 2022.

The winner on March 26 advances to a playoff final five days later against the team that emerges from the No. 2 seed vs. No. 3 seed pairing in its knockout bracket. Home advantage in the single-game playoff finals will be decided by the draw Thursday and not FIFA ranking.

The teams that eventually emerge from the four separate European playoff brackets are expected to be placeholders from low-ranked pot 4 in the Dec. 5 draw.

The intercontinental brackets will see top-seeded Iraq and Congo each await the winner of playoff semifinals that involve Bolivia, Jamaica, New Caledonia and Suriname.

European playoffs seeding:

Pot 1: Italy, Denmark, Turkey, Ukraine.

Pot 2: Poland, Wales, Czech Republic, Slovakia.

Pot 3: Ireland, Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo.

Pot 4: Northern Ireland, Romania, Sweden, North Macedonia.

Intercontinental playoffs:

Seeded: Congo, Iraq.

Unseeded: Bolivia, Jamaica, New Caledonia, Suriname.

“It's been an exciting and important year for our group, and we've accomplished a lot of goals, expanded the player pool and made strides in our game model, so this camp will be an extension of that, but it will also set the groundwork for 2026, which will be our World Cup qualifying year,” said Hayes. “Games against top European teams are so valuable as they give us an honest assessment of where we are in our growth as a team, so I know our players with embrace that challenge.”

The roster features the return of Olympic gold medalist Naomi Girma, who has been hampered by injuries during her time at Chelsea FC in England but started the Blues' UEFA Women's Champions League win over St. Polten on Nov. 11 and then played 45 minutes against Liverpool last weekend in Women's Super League play.

The roster features seven changes from the squad that participated in the October friendlies and includes two first-time call-ups in Bay FC goalkeeper Jordan Silkowitz and Chicago Stars forward Jameese Joseph. The other uncapped player is long-time U.S. YNT player and Washington Spirit defender Kate Wiesner, who earns her second USWNT call-up after being named as a training player during Hayes' first training camp in June of 2024.

The Latest | Nov 19, 2025

KANSAS CITY (Nov. 19, 2025) — Kansas City Current midfielder Claire Hutton and defender Izzy Rodriguez have been called up by the United States Women's National Team (USWNT) for the upcoming FIFA international window to close out the year. U.S. Soccer announced its 26-player roster on Wednesday as it continues preparation for Concacaf World Cup qualifying in Fall 2026.

After featuring in the Futures Camp earlier this year, Hutton received her first senior national team call-up in February for the 2025 SheBelieves Cup and has since appeared in all four subsequent USWNT camps. Rodriguez, whose first USWNT invitation was in June, earned her second senior team call-up.

The USWNT will face 2025 UEFA Women's Euro semifinalist Italy twice during the final camp of 2025 with both contests kicking off at 6 p.m. CT. The first match will be Friday, Nov. 28, at Inter&Co Stadium in Orlando, Fla., and will broadcast on TNT and HBO Max in English, Universo and Peacock in Spanish and on the radio on Westwood One Sports. The second game will be in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., on Monday, Dec. 1., at Chase Stadium which will air on TNT and HBO Max in English, Peacock in Spanish and on the radio in English on Westwood One Sports and in Spanish on Fútbol de Primera.

Entering this FIFA window, Hutton has been part of the starting lineup in seven of her nine caps and has recorded one goal and one assist. Rodriguez's international resume boasts one cap and one goal.

Hutton's first USWNT appearance was in the SheBelieves Cup earlier this year when she started against Australia and played 70 minutes. She joined the starting lineup again – and played every minute – in an April friendly against Brazil. Hutton, who was recently nominated for The Best FIFA Women's 11, also put in an 80-minute shift as a starter vs. Jamaica on June 3.

The midfielder had standout performances in the summer international window. She logged a full match against Ireland on June 26 before she registered her first career assist in another friendly with the Irish on June 29. Three days later, the 19-year-old notched her first international goal in the 36th minute in a 3-0 rout of Canada. Most recently, she appeared in all three matches during the October FIFA window, logging 144 minutes with two starts.

Rodriguez's consistent – and impressive – performances during the 2025 National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) season caught the attention of the USWNT, and she received her first senior team call-up during the summer FIFA window. She made her debut on June 29 in a 4-0 shutout over Ireland, finding the back of the net in the 42nd minute to become the 23rd player in the USWNT's 40-year history to score in their first cap. She was part of the starting lineup in that match and logged a full 90 minutes.

The defender had donned the red, white and blue on the international stage prior to her USWNT berth. She helped the USA win the 2016 Concacaf U-17 Championship and played at the 2016 FIFA U-17 World Cup. Two years later, she guided the U.S. to a runner-up finish at the 2018 U-20 Concacaf Championship and had two appearances at the 2018 FIFA U-20 World Cup.

Bay FC Communications

SAN JOSE, Calif. (Nov. 19, 2025) –U.S. Soccer announced today that Bay FC goalkeeper Jordan Silkowitz has been named to the U.S. Women's National Team roster for the upcoming November international window. Silkowitz will join the senior national team for the first time in her career as the squad hosts Italy for a pair of friendlies from Inter&Co Stadium in Orlando Nov. 28 and Chase Stadium in Fort Lauderdale Dec. 1. 

Silkowitz's call-up comes on the heels of a standout NWSL campaign for Bay FC that saw her rank fifth among all goalkeepers in saves, record four shutouts and win e.l.f Cosmetics Save of the Week, four times on a league-best 12 nominations. She appeared in all but two matches for Bay FC in 2025, making her NWSL debut on opening weekend at Utah March 15. In May, she earned her first selection to a national team program at any level, representing the U-23 Women's National Team as an overage player for training and matches in Germany. In Bay FC's two-year history, she's the second active player named to a U.S. senior squad all-time, joining defender Alyssa Malonson, who earned one cap across two selections by Head Coach Emma Hayes last fall.  

Kickoff for both friendly contests is set for 4 p.m. PT. The Nov. 28 match will broadcast live in the U.S. in English on TNT, and the Dec. 1 match will broadcast live in English on TBS. Both matches will stream on HBO Max and Westwood One Sports, and broadcast in Spanish on Universo and Peacock.  

The full USWNT roster named by Head Coach Emma Hayes features 26 players, including 20 from NWSL clubs. Silkowitz is one of two first-time call-ups on the squad, joining Chicago Stars FC forward Jameese Joseph, and three yet to make their senior debut alongside Joseph and Washington Spirit defender Kate Weisner. 23 players will be selected for the matchday roster for each contest.  

Bay FC fans can gear up for the club's 2026 season today and secure their spot at every home match with a season ticket membership, available at BayFC.com/tickets. Fans can also follow @wearebayfc on social channels for the latest club news and more exciting announcements to come throughout the offseason.

Let's repeat history. First drink on us.

First drink on us.

JERSEY CITY, N.J. (Nov. 19, 2025) - Five Gotham FC players have been named to the 26-player U.S. Women's National Team roster for its upcoming international friendlies against Italy.

Defenders Lilly Reale and Emily Sonnett and midfielders Jaelin Howell, Rose Lavelle and Jaedyn Shaw have all earned call-ups to represent the United States.

The 25-year-old Howell returns to the U.S. squad for the first time since April 9, 2022, when she scored her first and only international goal in a win over Uzbekistan. She was on the roster for the U.S. trip to Europe in October 2022 but did not see action. Howell made her USWNT debut on Nov. 27, 2020, against the Netherlands, becoming one of the first players born after the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup to earn a cap.

Lavelle and Sonnett are two of three players in their 30s called into the team this international window, joining Lindsey Heaps. Lavelle (115 caps) and Sonnett (112) hold the second and third-most caps on the roster behind Heaps (167). In the last window, Lavelle scored the seventh-fastest goal in USWNT history, finding the net just 33 seconds into the Oct. 23 match against Portugal. She recorded two goals during the window.

Shaw earns her second consecutive call-up after spending earlier FIFA windows this year with the U.S. U-23s. She has 29 caps and eight goals for the United States and became the first USWNT player to score in her first five starts.

Reale, a nominee for 2025 NWSL Rookie of the Year, returns to the senior U.S. roster, where she has made four appearances this year. She has played in every NWSL match for Gotham FC this season, including the semifinal win over Orlando in which she helped secure a clean sheet to send Gotham to the 2025 NWSL Championship.

The U.S. will face Italy in Florida twice in this window, first on Friday, Nov. 28, at Inter&Co Stadium in Orlando. The second match will take place Monday, Dec. 1, at Chase Stadium in Fort Lauderdale. Both matches will air on TNT and HBO Max in English and on Peacock in Spanish.

Before joining the U.S., all five players will feature in the 2025 NWSL Championship, presented by Google Pixel, when Gotham faces the Washington Spirit on Saturday at PayPal Park.

JUMP TO:

Qualification for the 2026 FIFA World Cup is into its final stages.

At the end of the November international break, the identity of 42 of the 48 finalists for the expanded international football showpiece will be known.

The remaining six spots will be filled by the UEFA and inter-confederation playoffs in March.

Argentina will defend their title after Lionel Messi completed his long and occasionally tortuous path to glory at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. La Albiceleste have since retained their Copa America title and finished top of the notoriously gruelling CONMEBOL qualifying section.

Here's everything you need to know about World Cup qualification, who has made it to the finals and how many teams from each continent will take part.

MORE: Who can qualify for the World Cup this week

Each confederation has more slots available under the expanded format. The AFC has double the qualification spots it had at Qatar 2022, up from four guaranteed places to eight, while there will be nine African nations instead of five.

CONCACAF will have at least double its 2022 representatives, up from three to six, although half of those slots are accounted for by the United States, Mexico and Canada qualifying automatically as hosts. As was the case at the previous World Cup, two slots will be decided via an inter-continental playoff.

Of note, Uzbekistan and Jordan both qualified for their first-ever World Cup appearances in the summer of 2025. By finishing top two in their group in the third round of AFC qualification, they secured an automatic bid to the competition.

Following them shortly after was Cape Verde, as the tiny island nation of just 600,000 people earned their first-ever World Cup spot by winning their group ahead of Cameroon. Beating that in November was Curacao, who became the smallest-ever nation to qualify for a World Cup with their population of 150,000.

The AFC began its crucial third round of qualification in September 2024. Eighteen teams were split across three six-team groups to contest 10 games in a round-robin format. The top two in each of Groups A, B and C qualified automatically for the World Cup.

The teams placed third and fourth in each group advanced to a fourth round split between two groups of three. Those groups were played out during the October international break, with Qatar and Saudi Arabia - the previous and next World Cup hosts - going through to the finals.

Runners-up the United Arab Emirates and Iraq played a two-legged tie in November to decide the AFC representative at the inter-confederation playoff. Iraq prevailed 3-2 on aggregate.

Nine groups of six teams played each other home and away in Africa. The winner of each section at the end of the 10 games progressed directly to the World Cup.

The four best runners-up from the initial round-robin phase entered into a playoff. DR Congo prevailed to with the playoff on penalties against Nigeria, moving them into March's inter-confederation round.

CONCACAF began the second round of its qualification phase in June 2024, with 30 teams drawn into six groups of five. Each team played every opponent in their group once, with two away games and two home games once the phase concluded in June 2025.

The top two in each group advanced to the 12-team third round, where there were three groups of four. Beginning in September 2025, the nations in each group played one another home and away. The three group winners advance to the World Cup, with the two best-ranked runners-up going into the inter-confederation playoff.

South America retained its celebrated marathon World Cup qualification round, with all 10 of the confederation's countries playing one another home and away in a gruelling league format. 

The expanded World Cup means qualification is a little easier, with the top six advancing automatically. Seventh-placed Bolivia will attempt to return to the World Cup for the first time since USA '94 in the inter-confederation playoff.

Argentina clinched their place at the finals thanks to a memorable 4-1 demolition of arch rivals Brazil. The Selecao ended the campaign in fifth spot, one of four teams to finish the campaign on 28 points.

The 2026 World Cup is the first time the OFC has been guaranteed a representative at the finals. The second round, running across October and November 2024, saw two groups of four playing for the four spots in round three.

The top two in each round-two group advanced to a three-match playoff in March 2025. New Caledonia defeated Tahiti in the first semifinal, with New Zealand thrashing Fiji 7-0 in the other.

New Zealand then claimed the automatic qualifying place by winning the OFC final 3-0. New Caledonia will enter the inter-confederation playoffs, so they have another chance to get there, albeit a slim one.

Twelve of UEFA's 16 spots will be taken by the group winners from the initial format of four or five-team groups. The 12 runners-up, along with the four best UEFA Nations League group winners that finished outside of the top two in their World Cup qualifying groups, enter the playoffs.

Those 16 teams will be drawn into four paths with two single-game rounds. The seeded teams will be at home in the semifinals, with a home nation for the four finals to be drawn prior to the match. The winners from each path advance to the World Cup. UEFA is the only confederation without a representative in the inter-continental playoff.

The two teams in the six-nation playoff with the highest FIFA ranking will be seeded. The four unseeded teams play an effective semifinal, with the two winners progressing to face a seed apiece to decide the final two places at the World Cup.

The four-game playoff will be used as a World Cup test event and played in one or more of the host countries.

Intercontinental Playoff participants

The 2026 FIFA World Cup kicks off on June 11, with co-hosts Mexico in action at the Azteca, which hosted the 1970 and 1986 World Cup finals.

MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, will host the final on July 19. The overall span of 40 days will make this the longest World Cup in history, with the 48 finalists contesting a total of 104 matches.

The 2026 FIFA World Cup draw takes place on December 5, 2025 in Washington, D.C.

Thomas Tuchel has to take Cole Palmer to the World Cup, especially after what has just come out about Chelsea's Club World Cup final against PSG. 

The international break is now behind us, but conversations about England will continue to bubble from now until June. 

Palmer's latest fitness update suggests he won't be back as soon as this weekend, which is a shame for many reasons. One is that he needs to start playing his way into Tuchel's plans. 

Chelsea insiders are confident Palmer will be selected, but he'll have a loftier ambition in mind — nailing down a starting berth. 

He should start for England, and tales from before last summer's Club World Cup final explain why. 

Back in July, Chelsea were faced with the unenviable task of facing a PSG side fresh off a Champions League title. 

The French giants were in a league of their own last season, and weren't a side anyone wanted to face. Anyone but Palmer, that is. 

As Matt Law reveals for the Telegraph, the Englishman was licking his lips at the prospect of clashing with Europe's best. 

Cole Palmer is desperate to go to the World Cup with England. Piece on:🔵 His Chelsea comeback🔵 Bulking up🔵 Staying involved🔵 Big-game mentality🔵 Making up for lost time https://t.co/Hj6dmOICeQ

He explains: “The victory over PSG was perhaps the best example so far of Palmer being a big-game player. Sources around the Chelsea dressing room have described the former Manchester City player as being like an excited puppy the day before the Club World Cup final.

“Where some players can see the possibility of failure and criticism, Palmer only sees opportunity and the chance to make an impact on the big stage. He does not worry what might be said or written about him and is virtually oblivious to any outside noise.” 

Tuchel has been warned not to make the same Palmer mistake that saw him used only as an impact sub in Germany last year, and this is just another reason. 

The England shirt is heavy on the shoulders of some. 

The hopes and dreams of a nation are at stake when international tournaments come around, which can be too much for certain players to handle. 

The Chelsea talisman lives for the big moment. We saw it in the Euros final against Spain, we saw it against PSG, and in Palmer's Player of the Match performance in the Conference League final. 

Tuchel is spoilt for choice in the forward areas, but someone like Palmer shouldn't have to warm the bench, especially when the lights are brightest. 

That's when he can make all the difference.

A Milestone That Redefines the Limits


Global football has witnessed a once-in-a-lifetime moment: Curaçao is now the smallest nation in history to qualify for a World Cup. With a population of just 156,115 inhabitants, according to the island's Central Bureau of Statistics, the Caribbean nation broke the record previously held by Iceland, which stunned the world at Russia 2018.





The achievement was sealed with a tense 0–0 draw in Kingston that confirmed Curaçao as the only unbeaten team in the tournament and the leader of Group B with 12 points. It marks the first World Cup qualification in the country's history, sparking a nationwide celebration.


A Shockwave From a Tiny Island


To understand the magnitude of this feat, it's enough to note how many far larger nations—with deeper resources, bigger talent pools, and stronger infrastructures—collapsed along the way. Curaçao, a territory smaller than many cities in the Americas, executed a flawless qualifying campaign built on discipline, clarity, and tactical consistency.

Much of the success stems from a foundational project that has grown steadily, supported by a generation of players with Dutch roots competing in European leagues. Their experience under pressure has been crucial in the moments that mattered most.






The Advocaat Effect, Even From Afar


The historic qualification comes with an emotional note: Dick Advocaat, the 78-year-old head coach behind the project, was unable to lead the decisive match after returning to the Netherlands due to family matters. Even so, his work had already shaped a disciplined, confident team on the brink of making history.

Advocaat adds this achievement to an extraordinary résumé that includes managing the Netherlands, South Korea, Belgium, and Russia, as well as winning league titles in multiple countries. His imprint on Curaçao is now permanently etched in Caribbean football history.


A New Era for Caribbean Football


Curaçao's qualification is not only a sporting triumph—it is a statement. With identity, structure, and courage, even the smallest nation can break barriers and reach the global stage. Now, the island prepares for its first World Cup with a sense of pride it has never experienced before.

Carlo Ancelotti has explained why he ordered Estevao Willian to hand Brazil's second penalty to Lucas Paqueta in the draw against Tunisia, with the West Ham star's subsequent miss proving costly for the Selecao. The five-time world champions squandered a host of chances throughout the 90 minutes as they limped to a 1-1 draw against the African nation in their final international match of 2025.

Brazil ended 2025 on a disappointing note as they were held to a 1-1 draw by a spirited Tunisia side, as Ancelotti oversaw his second draw as Selecao boss on Tuesday. The five-time world champions missed several chances throughout the game, including Rodrygo's early attempt, which was cleared off the line. Tunisia then took a shock lead in the 23rd minute as Hazem Mastouri broke the deadlock.

Casemiro and Vincius Junior then both came close to equalising before Estevao restored parity from a spot-kick in the 44th minute. Brazil were handed a second penalty in the 78th minute after Ferjani Sassi fouled Vitor Roque. Estevao, who had earlier converted a penalty, was instructed not to hand the kick over to West Ham star Lucas Paqueta, who then blazed over the crossbar.

Speaking to reporters after the game, Ancelotti explained why he ordered Estevao to stand down despite scoring the first-half penalty, telling reporters: "Paqueta was the penalty taker. For the second penalty, I changed because I wanted to take some of the pressure off Estevao, so I put Paquetá in, who usually takes them very well."

Analysing Brazil's overall performance, Ancelotti added: "Certainly, many, many (players). A few are missing, the list is quite complete. There are two friendlies left, but there are six months left, where anything can happen, the schedule is very demanding, the risk of injury is very high. The team, the atmosphere, are on the right track to reach the maximum level at the World Cup. 

"I have a lot of confidence in this team, in these players, and especially in this environment, which is a good environment. The players are serious, professional, and patriotic. They have a lot of affection for the shirt, and these are very important aspects."

Brazil will have two more friendlies in the March international break before they head to North America for the 2026 World Cup.

Ancelotti went on to reveal his message to the squad ahead of a lengthy international hiatus, saying: "I spoke with them (the players), wished them the best for the games they are going to play, we are observing them, staying in contact with them, talking, keeping the communication open until March and the World Cup. That's the idea we have, there's an observation process that will be very important."

Estevao, who has enjoyed a fine start to his career at Chelsea, scored in both the friendly matches that the Selecao played in November and is likely to be a key member of Ancelotti's World Cup squad next summer.

Tunisia boss Samsi Trabelsi hailed the youngster as a 'football genius' before Tuesday's game and backed the 18-year-old to become one of the best players of his generation. "I think he's a new football genius emerging, very young," he said. "I think he's doing very well and he's a player who can be expected to be among the greats, among the best in the world, certainly, in the coming years. If he manages to have good performances or win titles, whether with his club or national team, he will be among the players who, in the coming years, could even compete for the Ballon d'Or. He brings many solutions, a lot of technique, a lot of genius. There aren't many players of that level, of that category of genius, on the world stage."

From tiny Curaçao to the Tartan Army, jubilant fans celebrated Tuesday as a succession of minnows ended long waits to secure their spot alongside global icons and popular powerhouses competing for international sport's most coveted prize. 

Curaçao and Scotland — whose dramatic victory sent Edinburgh into rapture, kilts and all — are now among those to have qualified for next year's men's FIFA World Cup in North America.

The tournament will be the first to include 48 nations, including hosts Canada, Mexico and the United States, which thrashed Uruguay 5-1 on Tuesday to boost its standing.

While many will be eager to see the likes of holders Argentina and favorites Spain and England take center stage, some unlikely nations will now be joining them.

An island nation in the Caribbean, Curaçao made history by becoming the smallest country by population to ever qualify for the FIFA World Cup, a record that was previously set by Iceland in 2018. 

With a population of just over 155,000 people, the odds were set against them, but their 0-0 tie in Jamaica on Tuesday night saw them secure top spot in their group as their fans passionately chanted and waved their blue and yellow flags. 

“I think we deserve this,” a fan told Reuters. “It is time for us to celebrate right now.”   

The nation mired in upheaval and gang violence has qualified for the World Cup for the first time since 1974.

Because of the ongoing turmoil, the team's 52-year-old coach has been unable to set foot in the nation, despite being appointed 18 months ago. 

Nonetheless, soccer fans in the nation of about 12 million people were tensely watching the 2-0 win over Nicaragua and celebrations began in the capital Port-au-Prince as the referee blew the final whistle.

Though it regularly boasts players at top European teams and draws huge crowds, Scotland's soccer history is widely seen as one of glorious failure. Not so in Edinburgh on Tuesday, where a 4-2 upset victory over Denmark that included two epic stoppage time goals meant Scotland could avoid the perils of European playoffs and secure their first World Cup appearance in 28 years. 

“Never in doubt Scotland,” former World No. 1 tennis player Andy Murray wrote on X. “North America, here we come,” he added. 

Panama confirmed its second trip to a World Cup on the final matchday of qualifiers, defeating El Salvador 3-0.  

The Central American nation had to come through a difficult qualifying campaign, but the team eventually found its stride when it mattered most. 

Ranked 71st in the world and with a population of less than 500,000, the African nation sealed their first ever qualification last month and are now the third smallest country to take part in the tournament. 

The Blue Sharks will be making their first appearance at a World Cup after topping a competitive qualifying group. 

Two of the world's populous nations, India and China, will both continue their absence from the World Cup following disappointing performances in qualifying. 

Also not making the cut, despite the expansion to 48 nations, are regular fixtures like Nigeria, Cameroon, and Serbia. 

Others face an anxious wait, with a final playoff tournament to be held in Mexico next year.

Iraq, where soccer is hugely popular but which hasn't made the World Cup since it was last in Mexico in 1986, had to rely on a 107th minute penalty to book its spot at the intercontinental playoffs. 

Two teams will qualify from the tournament, which also includes Congo from Africa, Jamaica and Suriname from CONCACAF, Bolivia from South America and New Caledonia from Oceania.

Wales, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland have chance to qualify for the 2026 World Cup through play-offs in March; the draw will take place on Thursday at 12pm UK time; Italy, Denmark and Turkey among top seeds in draw; four European nations will reach tournament via play-offs

Wednesday 19 November 2025 11:13, UK

Wales, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland are headed for the World Cup play-offs with their hopes of qualifying for next summer's tournament still alive - so how do they work?

Gone are the days when UEFA qualifying group winners reached the finals, and the second-placed teams played each other to join them.

For the second cycle in a row, countries that have finished outside the top two of their UEFA qualifying group but performed well in the 2024/25 Nations League tournament will get a second bite of the cherry - but they will claim two extra play-off spots compared to the 2022 World Cup.

It's a complicated system which keeps outcomes in limbo longer than ever, but here's a handy guide about what to expect from Thursday's draw...

The draw will take place on Thursday at 12pm UK time from FIFA's home in Zurich, Switzerland. Follow live coverage on Sky Sports digital platforms.

The World Cup play-offs will take place in March 2026 and will consist of four 'paths', one for each vacant spot at the finals.

Every path will include a team from each of four seeding pots, with Pots 1-3 decided by November's FIFA World Rankings, while Pot 4 consists of the four countries qualifying through their Nations League performance.

              Latest World Cup news
            

The format will then proceed as follows in the one-legged semi-finals, hosted by the higher-ranking pot side:

The winner of the Pot 1 vs Pot 4 semi-final will then face the winner of the Pot 2 vs Pot 3 from their path semi-final for a place in the USA, Canada and Mexico World Cup. The host country for each final will be determined by a draw following the semi-finals.

The pots are as follows:

For the first time, 16 European teams will play at the World Cup owing to the 50 per cent increase in the size of the 2026 tournament. Of those, 12 places are reserved for UEFA qualifying group winners, with the other four coming via the play-offs.

The 12 group runners-up will be joined by four teams who finished outside the top two of their respective qualifying groups, who were the 'best performers' in the 2024/25 Nations League.

Here are the final standings from each of the 12 groups:

Yes! There is still a chance every home nation, plus the Republic of Ireland, could be in Canada, the USA and Mexico next summer.

England and Scotland are guaranteed their place after finishing top of their groups, with the Tartan Army qualifying for their first World Cup since 1998.

Wales are guaranteed a home draw in their play-off semi-final after thrashing North Macedonia 7-1 in their final group match to finish second in Group J.

Northern Ireland sealed a play-off spot owing to their Nations League performance, even though they did not finish in the top two of their qualifying group.

UEFA ranks Nations League teams first by the number of points won by group winners, from the top tier down to the fourth. More often than not, this means the four additional play-off spots are filled by four of the 14 Nations League group winners.

That's exactly the case here, with Northern Ireland, Romania and Sweden confirmed ahead of Tuesday - and North Macedonia sealing the fourth spot after losing to Wales in Cardiff.

Forty-two teams have qualified for the 2026 World Cup so far, with a list below:

Al Jazeera's breakdown of the qualified teams, playoffs and shock omissions from the FIFA World Cup in North America.

Emotions ran high on a night of historic wins and last-gasp goals as the last eight of the 43 automatic qualification spots for the FIFA World Cup 2026 were sealed across Europe (UEFA), Central America and the Caribbean (CONCACAF).

With less than seven months to go until the expanded 48-team tournament co-hosted by Canada, Mexico and the United States, European heavyweights Spain and the tiny Caribbean nation Curacao were among those to book a spot amid tears of joy and wild celebrations late on Tuesday.









Curacao became the smallest country ever – with a population of just 156,000 – to qualify for the World Cup on November 18 as Haiti booked their return to the tournament for the first time in 52 years, along with Panama.

 



 

It was also a week of heartbreak and shock for some of the biggest names in football, including former European champions Greece and African powerhouse Nigeria, as they were knocked out of contention for the most popular sports tournament in the world.

Meanwhile, four-time world champions Italy find themselves in the European playoffs along with 15 other teams in a fight for four slots, and four-time Arab champions Iraq booked a place in the intercontinental playoffs.

Here's what you need to know about the qualified teams, the playoffs and the biggest names to miss out on the FIFA World Cup 2026:

Following the last round of direct qualification, here's a continental breakdown of the qualified teams:

Co-hosts: Canada, Mexico and USA

Africa: Algeria, Cape Verde, Egypt, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Morocco, Senegal, South Africa, Tunisia

Asia: Australia, Iran, Japan, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Uzbekistan

Europe: Austria, Belgium, Croatia, England, France, Germany, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Scotland, Spain, Switzerland

Oceania: New Zealand

Americas: Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Uruguay, Curacao, Panama, Haiti

As late as March 31, 2026. With the European qualification rounds stretching to March and the intercontinental playoff final also scheduled for the same month, we will not know our final 48 teams for the World Cup until less than three months before the tournament.

The playoffs are divided into two parts: European and intercontinental.

The European leg will seal the last four UEFA spots in the World Cup, while the intercontinental playoff will see representatives of all other continental groups contest for the last two berths.

European playoff teams: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Czechia, Denmark, Italy, Kosovo, Poland, Republic of Ireland, Slovakia, Turkiye, Ukraine, Wales, Romania, Sweden, Northern Ireland, North Macedonia

Intercontinental playoff teams: Bolivia, DR Congo, Iraq, Jamaica, New Caledonia and Suriname

After eight months of group-stage qualifying matches, 12 of the 16 European teams – the most for any continent – at the World Cup were sealed when the 12 group winners were confirmed, with former champions Spain among them.

The last four places will be determined in the playoffs, which will be contested by 16 teams – 12 group runners-up from the regular qualifying round and the best four UEFA Nations League group winners – in March.

The teams will be divided into four playoff paths and four pots of four teams each, with the 12 group runners-up in three pots and the four other teams in the fourth pot.

Each of the four paths will comprise two single-leg semifinals and one single-leg final. The teams for the paths will be drawn on Thursday at 12:00 GMT.

The winners of the four finals will grab the last remaining UEFA spots for the World Cup.

The semifinals will be played on March 26 and the finals on March 31.

The intercontinental playoffs determine the last two non-European finalists for the World Cup, with six teams from the other four continental football bodies.

Asia will be represented by Iraq, Africa by DR Congo, CONCACAF by Jamaica and Suriname, Oceania by New Caledonia and South America by Bolivia.

The top two seeded teams – Iraq and DR Congo – have earned direct qualification for the two finals, while the other two finalists will be determined via two semifinals played between the four remaining teams.

The schedule for the intercontinental playoffs has not been confirmed.

Nigeria were among the latest big names to be eliminated from the qualification process, following on from Chile, who were third-place finishers in 1962.

While China are not considered among the football powerhouses in Asia, their focus on building the game at home and seeing themselves in another World Cup, following their 2002 appearance, was crushed on June 5.

Some of the other shock omissions: Cameroon, Mali, Costa Rica, Greece and Serbia.

US President Donald Trump confirmed, in August, that the draw for the World Cup will take place on December 5 at the Kennedy Center in Washington, and didn't rule out that he himself might oversee the event.

The draw will begin at noon local time (17:00 GMT).

Earlier this month, Ronaldo confirmed the tournament will be his swansong on football's biggest stage.

“Definitely, yes, because I will be 41 years old [at the World Cup],” said the Portuguese superstar, who is also the top scorer in history with 143 international goals.

“I gave everything for football. I've been in the game for the last 25 years. I did everything. I have many records in the different scenarios in the clubs and also in the national teams. I'm really proud. So let's enjoy the moment, live the moment.”

Meanwhile, Messi has also expressed hope that he will lead Argentina's title defence in North America but acknowledged that his age and fitness will dictate his role.

Speaking to NBC News in October, the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner said he will take time next year to assess his physical condition before deciding whether to play in the tournament.

“It's something extraordinary to be able to be in a World Cup, and I would love to,” the Argentinian captain said.

“I would like to be there, to be well, and be an important part of helping my team, if I am there. I'm going to assess that on a day-to-day basis when I start pre-season next year with Inter, and see if I can really be 100 percent, if I can be useful, and then make a decision.

“I'm really eager because it's a World Cup. We're coming off winning the last one, and being able to defend it on the field again is spectacular, because it's always a dream to play with the national team.”

The tournament begins on June 11 and ends on July 19.

The tournament will begin at the Mexico City Stadium, while the US will host the final at the MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.

We are now less than seven months out from the 2026 World Cup finals in the United States, Canada and Mexico, with the group-stage draw set to take place in Washington DC on December 5. Forty-two participating nations are locked in, with four teams from the UEFA play-offs and two intercontinental winners set to complete the line up in March. All of the so-called elite countries will be there, from holders Argentina and arch-rivals Brazil, to Euro 2024 winners Spain and France.

The tournament is expected to be the last dance for Lionel Messi, while the likes of Lamine Yamal, Vinicius Jr, Ousmane Dembele and Kylian Mbappe will all be out to try and upstage the Albiceleste icon. Elsewhere, Cristiano Ronaldo is set to match Messi as the only other player to ever feature at six World Cups when he leads out Portugal again, Harry Kane will carry England's hopes under Thomas Tuchel and Erling Haaland will step onto international football's grandest stage for the first time with dark horses Norway.

Several huge names will be fighting to join that list in the play-offs, but for some, the journey is already over. That is because the qualification stage claimed its fair share of notable scalps, including a pair of African giants and two countries from Europe and South America who have appeared at nine World Cup finals apiece.

Without further ado, GOAL runs through the biggest superstars who definitely won't be lighting up North America next summer...

Georgia were one of the surprise packages at Euro 2024, and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia was the driving force behind their run to the last 16 with his dizzying runs and relentless work rate. But the Paris Saint-Germain winger won't be strutting his stuff on the grandest stage of all next summer.

Kvaratskhelia did score twice in World Cup qualifying, including in a 3-0 win over Bulgaria, but Georgia lost four of their remaining five fixtures and finished a distant third behind Spain and Turkey in Group E. A chastening 4-1 defeat away to Turkey marked the lowest point, and head coach Willy Sagnol will have to go back to the drawing board to lift his confidence-stricken squad, which simply doesn't contain any other players who can come close to matching Kvaratskhelia's level.

Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is one of the finest strikers of his generation to never play at the World Cup, and after Gabon's latest qualification failure, it's safe to say that the 36-year-old will retire without ticking that box. Gabon booked a spot in the CAF play-offs after finishing second in their group, just one point behind Cote d'Ivoire, and Aubameyang contributed seven goals to their cause, including a superb quadruple haul in a thrilling 4-3 victory away at Gambia.

The former Arsenal and Borussia Dortmund star, who is now enjoying a second spell with Marseille at club level, led the line again in Gabon's blockbuster semi-final tie against Nigeria. Gabon fought hard to force extra-time, with Mario Lemina equalising in the 89th minute, but that appeared to zap all their energy, and Nigeria eventually emerged as 4-1 winners, with Victor Osimhen grabbing a brace. 

Gabon's search for a maiden World Cup appearance goes on, and their chances will surely only dwindle once they lose Aubameyang's services.

Bryan Mbeumo was born in central France and represented Les Bleus at Under-21 level, but in 2022, he switched allegiance to Cameroon, the land of his father. Three years on, there may be part of him that regrets that decision. 

Cameroon were embarrassingly beaten to automatic qualification for the 2026 World Cup by minnows Cape Verde, and were subsequently pitted against DR Congo in the CAF play-offs. Mbeumo played the full 90 minutes, alongside Manchester United colleague Andre Onana and Brighton's Carlos Baleba, but DR Congo won the contest 1-0, courtesy of a stoppage-time winner from Chancel Mbemba. Mbeumo, who has only scored seven goals in 27 games for Cameroon to date, was guilty of missing a clear chance in the second half, and went viral for storming down the tunnel after the final whistle.

The Indomitable Lions have played at more World Cups than any other African nation (eight), but the current team doesn't hold a candle to those from the past. Turmoil away from the pitch has continually detracted from any progress in recent years, and the path forward looks anything but clear, with Marc Brys reportedly set to be relieved of his managerial duties.

Serbia have failed to qualify for the World Cup for the first time since 2014, and this failure will no doubt sting more than most. Head coach Dragan Stojkovic resigned after a dismal 1-0 home defeat to Albania in October, and Serbia were officially eliminated from the process after a 2-0 defeat to England at Wembley last Thursday.

England romped through as Group K winners with a perfect record, while Albania made the play-offs for the first time in their history. It was a nightmare campaign for Serbia and, more specifically, Dusan Vlahovic, who mustered only two goals and went completely missing in the double-headers against England and Albania.

The Juventus star has yet to prove himself as a top-class striker and questions have been asked over his future in Turin. With only 16 goals to his name from 41 international games, he has done little to inspire Serbia either, and his stock will be lower than ever when the transfer market reopens.

Group F was easily one of the most dramatic of the European qualification groups, with the top two only decided in the final round of matches. Portugal annihilated Armenia 9-1 to claim top spot, and Hungary were literally seconds away from nabbing the runners-up spot, only to be denied by Ireland's hat-trick hero Troy Parrott. 

The former Tottenham forward poked home from close range in the sixth minute of stoppage time to earn Ireland a 3-2 win in Budapest, sparking wild scenes of celebration in the away dugout. But in stark contrast, Hungary captain Dominik Szoboszlai was seen breaking down in tears.

Some Ireland fans may have seen that as karma, because the Liverpool star was spotted celebrating Hungary's second goal of the game by sticking his finger up his nose and wiggling it around in the direction of the benches, but few players had done more to drag their nation towards North America than Szoboszlai.

A World Cup berth would have been just reward for his return of five goal contributions from six matches, which included a stunning stoppage-time leveller against Portugal. Szoboszlai's Liverpool team-mate Milos Kerkez also impressed, but Hungary were undone by complacency in the end, and their wait for a 10th World Cup finals outing will now extend to 44 years. 

Nigeria will miss out on successive World Cups after suffering a shock African final play-off defeat to DR Congo. The Super Eagles were hot favourites to make it through to a final intercontinental playoff in March after seeing off Gabon, but DR Congo shattered their dreams after a gruelling contest that was ultimately decided on penalties.

The two teams played out a 1-1 draw in normal time, and Nigeria's attacking threat evaporated after Osimhen was withdrawn at the interval with a leg issue. DR Congo were unfortunate not to find a second goal, but luck shone on them in the shootout as they earned a 4-3 victory. 

It never should have come to this for what is undoubtedly a golden generation for Nigeria. The absence of Osimhen will be an especially great shame when the World Cup kicks off, given the Galatasaray star is among the best strikers in the business. He scored eight goals in qualifying, but the rest of the Nigeria squad did not match his high standards. The likes of Ademola Lookman, Alex Iwobi, Samuel Chukwueze, Calvin Bassey and Wilfred Ndidi all disappointed, and will need to do some serious soul searching.

Things might have been different had Osimhen not missed three games due to injury, but Nigeria have become far too reliant on the former Napoli man. He will be 30 by the time the next World Cup rolls around, which means his prime years will have gone to waste from a global perspective.

Alexis Sanchez has enjoyed a glittering career that has included successful spells at Barcelona, Arsenal and Inter, while he also shone for Chile at the 2014 World Cup. The diminutive forward, now at the ripe old age of 36, won't get the chance to grace that stage again, though.

Chile narrowly fell short of qualifying for both the 2018 and 2022 finals, but they were miles away this time around, finishing bottom of the CONMEBOL table with only 11 points from 18 games. A serious calf problem ruled Sanchez out of their first eight matches, and he was exiled from the squad entirely after the September appointment of new manager Nicolas Cordova.

Sanchez did feature in a 1-0 home loss to Argentina and a 2-0 reversal at Bolivia, but was a shadow of his old self. He has not officially retired from international duty, but Chile are embarking on a new era without their long-time talisman, for better or worse.

Benjamin Sesko is going through the toughest period of his fledgling career. The 22-year-old has failed to hit the ground running at Old Trafford after swapping RB Leipzig for Manchester United in the summer, and has not been able to rebuild any confidence while away on international duty with Slovenia.

Sesko played every minute of Slovenia's first four World Cup qualifiers, but didn't register a single goal or assist as the team amassed only three points from a possible 12. He then picked up a knee injury that left him watching on powerlessly from the sidelines as Slovenia were beaten 2-0 at home by Kosovo in November, ending their faint hopes of making it to next summer's tournament.

Slovenia haven't qualified since 2010, and it's difficult to see them ending that barren run anytime soon. Beyond Sesko, there is precious little quality to speak of in their outfield ranks, with only goalkeeper Jan Oblak capable of performing at a world-class level. Sesko puts in plenty of effort, but he's not a miracle worker; with no proper service he and Slovenia will continue to meander along for the foreseeable future.

When Keylor Navas came out of international retirement in May 2025, he did so with playing at his fourth World Cup in mind. The three-time Champions League-winning goalkeeper may now be 38 and winding down his career in Mexico with Pumas, but he was immediately re-installed as Costa Rica captain for their qualifying campaign as they aimed to take advantage of the three best teams in CONCACAF being co-hosts and thus not being involved.

And while Navas only conceded six goals in his six qualifying appearances, a lack of goals at the other end of the pitch saw Costa Rica win just one match on their way to finishing third in Group C behind Honduras and winners Haiti. That means for just the second time in the 21st century, Los Ticos will not be at the finals.

Few strikers have been more prolific than Serhou Guirassy across Europe over the past few seasons. Since the start of the 2023-24 campaign, the Borussia Dortmund frontman has netted 75 goals in all competitions at club level and finished as the joint-top scorer in last season's Champions League. Subsequently, Guinea were hopeful that he could carry that form into the international arena and fire them to their first World Cup.

Guirassy, however, came up massively short, as he scored just once during a qualifying campaign that saw Guinea finish fourth in their group behind Algeria, Uganda and Mozambique. They won just four of their 10 matches as Guirassy failed to produce anything of note in the final third.

Swedish international striker, Roony Bardghji, who left FC Copenhagen to devote his future to FC Barcelona, says he hopes to meet Denmark in the playoffs for the World Cup qualification.

Roony Bardghji left FC Copenhagen for FC Barcelona on 14 July 2025, signing a four-year contract until 2029. The transfer was motivated by his desire to seek new challenges in a different environment, with FC Copenhagen stating he had fulfilled his ambition to test himself elsewhere.

Now he could make an unexpected return to the Parken Stadium as Sweden potentially could face Denmark in the Danish national arena in Copenhagen in the semi-final of the World Cup qualification playoffs.

"I heard that we can get Denmark. That would be nice. They are all tough opponents, but Denmark would be nice. It is also close, so you don't have to travel that far", he tells the Swedish news agency TT.

"I think we have the best chance against Denmark."

The draw for the World Cup qualification playoffs will be made on Thursday.

Curacao have qualified for their first World Cup after drawing with Jamaica

The tiny Caribbean island of Curacao has become the smallest nation to ever qualify for the World Cup after drawing with Steve McClaren's Jamaica.

The record was held by Iceland, who reached the 2018 finals, but their country is far bigger than Curacao, which has a population of just over 150,000 (similar to Cambridge or Huddersfield) and a land area of 171 square miles, smaller than the Isle of Man.

Former England boss McClaren resigned as Jamaica boss after his side, who needed a win in Kingston to qualify for their first World Cup since 1998, were held to a goalless draw, including having an injury-time penalty overruled by VAR.

Curacao boss Dick Advocaat, who was not at the game for personal reasons, will become the oldest coach at a World Cup, aged 78, beating Otto Rehhagel's record when he was in charge of Greece aged 71 in 2010.

Curacao, 37 miles off the Venezuela coast, only became a country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands in 2010, following the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles.

Ten years ago they were 150th in Fifa's world rankings. Now they are 82nd.

The expanded 2026 World Cup format, which features 48 nations instead of 32, along with the fact hosts Canada, Mexico and the United States all qualify automatically, has given Curacao a much-improved chance as they become the fourth debutant at next summer's tournament - joining Cape Verde, Uzbekistan and Jordan.

"It's crazy and would be one of the biggest things that will happen to Curacao," said midfielder Juninho Bacuna, a former Huddersfield, Rangers and Birmingham player before the match.

Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live, he added: "It's incredible and amazing. Even a few years ago you would not even think about it.

"To be personally part of it and to make that dream come true would be incredible."

In 10 qualifying matches, they have won seven and finished their campaign unbeaten.

Their fairytale looked shattered in the fourth of the five minutes added on at the end of the game when Curacao substitute Jeremy Antonisse appeared to have brought down Isaac Hayden and the El Salvador referee Ivan Barton immediately pointed to the spot.

But the referee was quickly encouraged by the VAR officials to check the incident on the small touchline screen and reversed his own decision to the consternation of the crowd.

They will be joined at the World Cup by Haiti and Panama from the Conacaf qualifying, with Jamaica having to go into the Intercontinental play-offs.

The Caribbean Island of Haiti sealed their place at a first World Cup since 1974 after defeating Nicaragua 2-0.

When is the 2026 World Cup draw?

Since January 2024, Dutchman Advocaat, 78, has been in charge of his eighth national side after three spells with the Netherlands, as well as coaching the United Arab Emirates, South Korea, Belgium, Russia, Serbia and Iraq.

He helped the Netherlands reach the quarter-finals of the 1994 World Cup and his South Korean team went out in the group phase in 2006.

His list of clubs managed includes PSV Eindhoven, Rangers, Zenit St Petersburg, Sunderland and Feyenoord.

Advocaat only became Curacao boss after a payment dispute between the players and the country's football association was resolved, and he immediately set his sights on qualifying for the 2026 World Cup.

"Everyone knows Dick Advocaat is a big name, he is a big coach and everyone respects him in his decisions and the way he works," added Bacuna. "His presence is really important for us as a team and also for the country, and his impact has been really big.

"We started working with him in qualifying for the Nations League and we saw a growth in the team in the way we worked and the way we fought in games."

Curacao fans celebrate in Jamaica

As well as having a Dutch manager, the majority of players in the Curacao squad were born in the Netherlands but had family links that enabled them to play for Advocaat's side.

Their squad includes Livingston defender Joshua Brenet, Rotherham midfielder Ar'jany Martha, Middlesbrough forward Sontje Hansen and Sheffield United midfielder Tahith Chong, who was born in Curacao and previously played in the Premier League with Manchester United.

For Bacuna, playing for Curacao was also a chance to play international football with his older brother Leandro, the national side's captain, and that was a key part of his motivation after he had represented the Netherlands at under-21 level.

"I started to play for Curacao in 2019 and it was a big decision for me," said Juninho Bacuna. "At that time I was only 21 and had a lot of years in front of me to see my chances for the Dutch national team.

"But I made a choice early to play for Curacao. One of the reasons was I can play in the same team as my brother and for the family to see us play together.

"The other reason was at the time my chances of playing for the Dutch national team, realistically, was not there. I saw a lot of players from my age already play for the Dutch national team but I didn't have a chance to be called up, so the choice was quick to make to play for Curacao."

But Bacuna felt the country's recent footballing progress would inspire more Dutch-born players to represent the team known as The Blue Family.

"We're seeing more players that are still young and able to play for Holland and they come to play for Curacao - and make the team even stronger," added Bacuna.

The United States men's national team will end 2025 on a strong note after defeating Uruguay 5-1 on Tuesday night at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Fla. Without regulars such as Christian Pulisic and Tyler Adams, the USMNT didn't miss a beat. Three players scored their first-ever USMNT goals, led by Sebastian Berhalter's goal and assist and Alex Freeman's brace. Tanner Tessmann joined the fun off the bench to add his first USMNT goal, as this squad has done everything to make World Cup squad decisions as tough as possible for Mauricio Pochettino.

Tactical wrinkles shined as right back Sergino Dest was moved to winger ahead of Freeman, and it led to overloads left and right on Uruguay's defense to great effect. Nine changes from the USMNT's win over Paraguay wouldn't slow them down as Mark McKenzie took the captain's armband and helped the team secure a statement victory. Freeman and Berhalter made their cases for being on the World Cup squad, but Gio Reyna also helped enhance his own.

Coming off the bench, Reyna delivered an assist to Tessmann for the fifth goal and ensured that the team would stretch their unbeaten run to five consecutive games. They now won't get together again until March of 2026 so it's great to make a good, potentially final, impression.

It's a statement victory for the USMNT as they stretched their unbeaten run to five games to end 2025. They've hit their stride under Mauricio Pochettino, and no matter who is in the lineup, an identity is forming. Let's take a look at the goals:

68' 5-1: It's the high fives for the USMNT as Tanner Tessemann gets his first USMNT goal following an excellent delivery from Gio Reyna.

45' 4-1: Uruguay gets an opener via De Arrascaeta, and it's a heck of a goal. This half has had everything.

41' 4-0: Go Diego, Go!! This time it's Diego Luna, and Mauricio Pochettino looks on like he expected the goal to happen. This is quickly becoming the best 45 minutes that we've seen under Pochettino as the USMNT are flying!

31' 3-0: Freeman has a brace now! It's still the first half of play, and everything is coming up in the USMNT's favor. What a start!

20' 2-0: Twice as nice! Another set play, another goal! This time it's Alex Freeman who scores with a long range header. Guess who, Sebastian Berhalter on the assist.

16' 1-0: Sebastian Berhalter straight from the training ground! After needing to retake the free kick he played a give-and-go before firing it into the back of the net from an acute angle to open the scoring. Berhalter is making a strong case to make the World Cup squad as a set-piece specialist.

John Tolkin will leave the match after taking a knock for Max Arfsten, while Timmy Tillman will also leave the match for Brenden Aaronson to close this out with fresh legs.

Tanner Tessemann scores with a header following an assist from Gio Reyna and the USMNT are scoring for fun!

It's a rash challenge on Sebastian Berhalter, and Uruguay will be down to 10 men for the remainder of the match.

Already up 4-1 at 60 minutes? Why not make some changes? Balogun, Tessemann, and Reyna enter while Wright, Dest, and Luna exit.

It has been a sleepy start to the second half in comparison to how back and forth the first was, but Matt Freese was ready to turn a dangerous shot in behind for a corner kick.

Mauricio Pochettino may have a good problem that too many players are looking to make their case to be in the World Cup squad. We're back underway with no changes in the second half as the USMNT looks to push for more.

I'm running out of supurlatives for the USMNT at this rate as now Diego Luna joins the fun. He's someone who needs the goal as he's needed to show that he can score against top opposition, and this is quickly becoming a 10 out of 10 performance for the entire squad in the first half of play.

Every time the USMNT goes forward, it's turning into a goal, as this has quickly become a domination of Uruguay. Alex Freeman has basically booked his spot in the World Cup squad with this performance so far. 

Tolkin found Alex Freeman's head from another corner but the defender couldn't keep it down. The USMNT are racking up chances from set plays in the early going, and Uruguay will need to adjust.

When you can't make things work in possession, it's important to use set plays to your advantage. From start to finish with Haji Wright drawing the free kick to Berhalter driving it home to score. Things then escalated quickly as Berhalter added an assist to his name with a great corner kick delivery, and the USMNT are flying early. 

Essentially playing as a winger in front of Alex Freeman, Sergino Dest was able to win a corner for the USMNT, but Tillman's header was easily cleared. It's a promising spell in possession from the USMNT to start this off.

As expected, it's a game of pinball in the early going between the two teams, with the USMNT struggling to hold possession, but the defense has been ready to keep the South American side from pushing into the attacking third.

The stage is set for quite a clash between two teams who will be heading to the World Cup in 2026.

The USMNT are playing in a friendly in an NFL stadium for the first time since a 5-1 defeat to Colombia before the Copa America, and what a quirky venue they've picked in Raymond James Stadium, home of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The stadium is famed for its pirate ship and the cannon (no word on whether it will go off at all tonight) but I was caught by surprise by the small fake beaches that appear right outside the venue. When in Florida, I suppose!

Facing Uruguay, the match will be a fight, but it's also one that the USMNT can win. The shift to a back three has increased their room for error, and this is a match which will see just how far that goes with Pochettino ringing in the changes. With only two players who started versus Paraguay getting the nod in a second consecutive match, it will likely see Uruguay get off to a fast start before the USMNT finds a way to equalize in the second half of play. Score: USMNT 1, Uruguay 1

The back three will remain, but only two starters from the Paraguay match will be in from the start to face Uruguay: Matt Freese and Sergino Dest. There may be heavy rotation, but it provides Pochettino to test different things against top quality opposition. How the defense lines up will be something to watch as Dest could be pushed forward with Alex Freeman operating in a standard back four or we could see something where Freeman is at center back.

USMNT starters: Matt Freese, Sergino Dest, Auston Trusty, Mark McKenzie, Alex Freeman, John Tolkin, Tanner Tessemann, Adian Morris, Timmy Tillman, Diego Luna, Haji Wright

While Pochettino will likely make a few changes to his XI, it's a good time to see more of the players who impressed versus Paraguay like Gio Reyna. Continuity has been tough to come by with how many changes the USMNT have had to make to the roster from break to break, so being able to run out most of the same defense in front of Freese would be good to see.

Predicted USMNT starters: Matt Freese, Max Arfsten, Tim Ream, Mark McKenzie, Joe Scally, Sergino Dest, Adian Morris, Cristian Roldan, Diego Luna, Gio Reyna, Folarin Balogun

It's a sunny end to 2025 for the USMNT in Tampa, Florida, where they'll face tough opposition in Uruguay. Marcelo Biesla's men are coming off a 0-0 draw with Mexico, as he'll face a coach who he's quite familiar with in fellow Argentine Mauricio Pochettino. It's another test for the USMNT as they prepare for the World Cup on home soil. With improving form, as the USMNT have shifted to a back three, this is an opportunity to end the year on a high note, with their next international break not being until March of 2026.

The U.S. men's national team head into 2026 full of confidence after defeating Uruguay 5–1 at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, F.L.

Marcelo Bielsa's Uruguay provided a benchmark of sorts on the night given their overall quality. Yet, it was the USMNT who dominated. A heavily rotated side looked organized and well-coached against the two-time World Cup winners. Their mid-block stifled Uruguay in possession as they found it difficult to play through the lines.

Sebastian Berhalter, Alex Freeman and Diego Luna were all on the scoresheet in a first half blitz. The USMNT showcased their quality in transition, possession and on set pieces. A side missing Christian Pulisic, Chris Richards, Weston McKennie, Tim Weah and others looked superior all night.

A complete performance and the perfect sendoff given they won't play again until March. For all the trials and tribulations this team has dealt with in 2025, they certainly look transformed under Pochettino.

*Ratings Provided by FotMob

GK: Matt Freese—6.5: Sloppy defending at the back cost the USMNT a clean sheet in the first half resulting in De Arrascaeta's stunning effort. While his starting place likely isn't in jeopardy, Pochettino will want Freese to be more calm and assured moving forward.

CB: Alex Freeman—9.0: The Orlando City star is one of the best stories of the Pochettino era. Two goals on the night in an altered role has all but locked up his spot come 2026.

CB: Mark McKenzie (c)—6.8: Captained the USMNT. McKenzie was accurate out of the back, but will be unhappy with how disorganized the defense was on Uruguay's lone goal.

CB: Auston Trusty—7.6: Trusty was composed in place of Tim Ream. Given the competition for defensive places, the Celtic man might have an outside shot at making the cut next year.

RM: Sergiño Dest—7.6: Another positive performance for the PSV defender. Dest certainly is a starter when fit and could be even more dangerous if Freeman plays behind him in a hybrid role.

CM: Aidan Morris—7.3: Had his work cut out for him against a talented Uruguay midfield. Kept things ticking completing the most passes of any player.

CM: Sebastian Berhalter—8.6: Did Berhalter just play his way into a 2026 World Cup roster spot? He might not be a starter, but his effort and set piece quality could make him a weapon next summer.

LM: John Tolkin—7.3: The 23-year-old was solid in place of Max Arfsten moving up and down the left flank. A potential depth option if injuries arise.

RW: Timothy Tillman—6.8: Looked timid at times on the ball, but worked hard and influenced two goals on the night. It remains to be seen if he'll be involved come 2026.

ST: Haji Wright—6.3: Quiet and a bit off the pace on the night at times given the USMNT's attacking prowess.

LW: Diego Luna—7.9: Scored the fourth goal of the game and was a consistent force in the attacking third. One of his better performances in a USMNT shirt.

Pochettino made nine changes to the side that defeated Paraguay on Saturday. A gamble given fans wanted to see him stick with a strong lineup to close out the year. Freeman, after being in the middle of a benches-clearing brawl, started at right center back with Dest in front of him. 

Both traditional wingbacks were lively early overlapping on runs while showcasing their quality on the ball. Uruguay often tried to deny passes out wide sending two players to close down passing lanes. The USMNT's most dangerous moment of the opening exchange came in the 15th minute after Wright won a free kick right outside the penalty area.

The USMNT made the most of their opportunity with a screamer from Berhalter. The Vancouver Whitecaps midfielder played it short to Dest before he laid it back off for Berhalter curling in a sensational effort. Shades of Toni Kroos's 2018 heroics against Sweden in the World Cup.

Shortly thereafter, Berhalter turned provider with a pinpoint corner as Freeman headed home at the far post. All by design as well. The USMNT consistently focused on sending crosses to the back post and were rewarded for their preparation.

Freeman doubled his tally in the 30th minute. Relentless effort from Tillman and Trusty pressing high forced a turnover in the final third as Freeman danced around the box and fired a shot low to beat Fiermarin. The MLS Young Player of the Year's emphatic performance solidified his bid for a 2026 roster spot.

Luna added a fourth just on the verge of halftime. A slick passing sequence between Trusty, Tolkin and Tillman created another big chance as Luna made a late run into the box. A slight deflection benefitted the Real Salt Lake star as he calmly rolled the ball into the back of the net.

Some calamity at the back gave Uruguay a lifeline as De Arrascaeta scored a highlight-reel worthy overhead kick in first-half stoppage time. For all the talk of intensity and effort coming into the game, though, it was the USMNT who dominated the first 45. Pochettino was even the more animated manager going into the tunnel unhappy with how his team switched off.

Bielsa made multiple changes to start the second half looking for a spark. Pochettino followed with changes on the hour mark introducing Gio Reyna, Folarin Balogun and Tanner Tessmann. 

Things went from bad to worse for Uruguay in the 65th minute as Bentancur was shown a red card for a high challenge on Berhalter. The USMNT smelled blood in the water and pressed on looking for more goals. 

Reyna put a ball into the box on a platter as Tessmann rose highest to beat Fiermarin. The USMNT closed up shop from there to close the door on 2025. Pochettino remained undefeated against CONMEBOL teams as USMNT boss improving his record to 3-1-0.

World Cup

2026 World

Cup Countdown

A stunning first half saw Mauricio Pochettino's USMNT continue its unbeaten run with victory over Uruguay in Tampa, Fl. 

First international goals from Sebastian Berhalter (17) and Alex Freeman (21, 32) were followed by Diego Luna (43) in an incredible opening 45 minutes against Marcelo Bielsa's visitors. 

Giorgian De Arrascaeta's bicycle kick on the stroke of half-time did at least get Uruguay on the board, but Tottenham midfielder Rodrigo Bentancur was sent off (64) for a challenge on Berhalter before Tanner Tessmann (68) completed the scoring at Raymond James Stadium. 

The U.S. signs off for 2025 with a five-game unbeaten run, all coming against teams that will feature at next summer's World Cup being co-hosted by Mexico, Canada and the United States.

USMNT 5, Uruguay 1: Freeman, Berhalter make World Cup case in stunning rout

The U.S. Soccer Federation and Portuguese Football Federation will soon confirm an exhibition match between their men's teams to take place at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta in March 2026, per our writer Adam Crafton.

Portugal has confirmed their place at the World Cup after beating Armenia 9-1 on Sunday.

The Portugal match is also significant because it will bring an end to an almost 12-year absence for Cristiano Ronaldo from playing soccer in the United States. 

He last played in the States on August 2, 2014, when he came on as a substitute for Real Madrid against Manchester United in front of a crowd of 109,318 at Michigan Stadium in Ann Arbor.

USMNT pre-World Cup game vs. Portugal to be announced as Cristiano Ronaldo set for U.S. return

It's glaring to see a Uruguay side give up in the first half. After Marcelo Bielsa told reporters on Saturday he expected a better performance versus the U.S. this was an utterly shocking result. Bielsa post-match said:

💬 “I cannot defend this result. I feel that what is most affected after this performance is my approach to the match, how I prepare the players.”

TAMPA, Fla. – A depleted and rotated U.S. men's national team stunned Uruguay, 5-1, in a friendly here at Raymond James Stadium on Tuesday. The USMNT blew past expectations, and past a team full of World Cup veterans, to close 2025 on a high.

The U.S. is now unbeaten in its last five games, with wins over the likes of Japan, Paraguay and Uruguay in that span.

The Americans raced out to a 4-0 lead via goals from three players who weren't in the national team picture at this time last year: Sebastian Berhalter, Alex Freeman and Diego Luna.

Another goal hero tonight was Sebastian Berhalter and he was my pick of players tonight, for sure. Again, here he is speaking to TNT …

💬 “We wanted to make a statement, to show what U.S. Soccer is all about. To show we're ready, especially against a good Uruguay team. This was awesome.

“We want to give the fans something to believe in and hopefully today we did that. Everyone did their role and a little bit more, and to get this win, in this fashion, in front of these fans, was pretty special.”



We went into tonight wondering what nine changes would mean for this U.S. team. 

Well, they put in maybe the best shift of a U.S. team this year, dominating an Uruguay team that looked plain awful tonight. 

A 5-1 win. Five straight unbeaten. Considering how 2025 started with the failure at the March Nations League, this team certainly looks like it has an identity and is gaining confidence under Mauricio Pochettino. 

Now they get a four-month break to let it marinate ...

Orlando City forward and two-goal hero Alex Freeman has spoken to TNT Sports: 

💬 “It was something special, playing in my home state, I had to show up … especially with my family here and I hope we can all build on this. 

“It's been important to build our chemistry but also our confidence between each other and getting results.

“Not only have we played good. We've dominated the games. That's great for any team.”



What will Mauricio Pochettino have learned from tonight?

That he is going to have some serious decisions to make for his first squad of 2026.

There were big names missing in this international window but you know what? They looked a much better team in these two games than any of the previous ones I'd seen.

Hopefully those missing figures will have registered what has happened and what it should look like for when they get called back into the squad.  

FT: USMNT 5-1 Uruguay 

Look at that … No stoppage time!

And no stopping the United States tonight either. An incredible way to end 2025 and a fine platform to build on for 2026 and a World Cup year where the the world will come to the U.S.

I suspect there will be a buzz around the place for months, off the back of that performance.

Excellent. 

89' USMNT 5-1 Uruguay 

One more change from Mauricio Pochettino, as Cristian Roldan comes on for Aidan Morris.

Nearly done.

84' USMNT 5-1 Uruguay 

Sebastian Berhalter takes it but it looks like a bit of a floater, and it hits the top of the wall anyway.

The resulting corner is claimed by Fiermarin — which feels like a win for him. 

82' USMNT 5-1 Uruguay 

Into the final 10 minutes and USMNT has a free kick in a central position, crying out for someone to shoot here. Aguirre is booked for the challenge on Morris that conceded it. 

For the record, Max Arfsten amd Brenden Aaronson are now out there for the U.S., with Tillman and Tolkin making way.  

76' USMNT 5-1 Uruguay 

Here is that Tanner Tessmann goal to make it five. I'm sure we're all blasé about the scoreline now, right?

Meanwhile, it is getting feisty out there now. Brin Rodrigues leaves the game with blood pouring from his nose and that challenge earns Balogun a yellow card.

Reyna has also been booked for a late challenge.

Bearing in mind Saturday's friendly against Paraguay ended with a mass brawl, who's to say what we'll get over the remaining 12 minutes here … 

68' USMNT 5-1 Uruguay 

And with Uruguay down to 10 men, the USMNT's fifth goal soon arrives!

Tanner Tessmann heads home Gio Reyna's cross after a U.S. corner is played short and that is number five.

It also owes a lot of Cristopher Fiermarin comes out to claim a cross he was nowhere near reaching. Oops. 

64' USMNT 4-1 Uruguay 

From bad to worse for Uruguay. Tottenham midfielder Rodrigo Bentancur is sent off for a high challenge that goes over the ball and lands on the shin of Sebástian Berhalter.

The visitors are three goals down and now a man down too. 



60' USMNT 4-1 Uruguay 

We hit the hour mark and Mauricio Pochettino makes his first changes.

Into the game come Folarin Balogun, Gio Reyna and Tanner Tessmann.

Making way are Deigo Luna, Haji Wright and Sergiño Dest — who looks fully back in favor. He's had two excellent games in this international window.

57' USMNT 4-1 Uruguay 

Smart shot towards Matt Freese's near post from De Arrascaeta, which is turned onto the post. 

We are just simmering along in this second half at the moment, but I wonder if there is going to be another spark soon. It feels like it. 

54' USMNT 4-1 Uruguay 

Have to say, Uruguay looks just as open at the back in the second half as they did for the majority of the first. 

Another goal for the U.S. absolutely kills this as a contest, if it ever was one. 

50' USMNT 4-1 Uruguay 

Brian Rodríguez is into the book after a late challenge on the ankles of John Tonkin.

There was a double change from Marcelo Bielsa at the break, by the way. Joaquin Piquerez and Rodrigo Aguirre are on with Vinas and Vina making way. 

46' USMNT 4-1 Uruguay 

So then, a big half for the U.S. ahead?! Maybe. We're back underway in Tampa …

Italy booked its fourth consecutive semi-final berth at the Davis Cup Finals on Wednesday, overcoming Austria with the help of a thunderous home crowd and confident performances by Matteo Berrettini and Flavio Cobolli.

The atmosphere inside the SuperTennis Arena in Bologna set the tone early, and two-time defending champions responded with the assurance of seasoned contenders.

Berrettini, the former No. 6 in the PIF ATP Rankings, handed Italy a 1-0 lead with his 6-3, 7-6(4) victory over Jurij Rodionov. The second set was briefly delayed due to lighting issues in the stadium, but the Italian rallied from a 2-5 deficit and saved three consecutive set points on serve at 4-5, swinging the momentum back in his favour before dominating the tie-break.

Cobolli then stepped up and delivered a resounding 6-1, 6-3 win against Filip Misolic in just his third Davis Cup rubber, sending the home fans into a frenzy. With its win, Italy extended its winning streak to 12 ties and set a semi-final showdown with Belgium on Friday.

As Italy pursues a fourth Davis Cup crown, Berrettini's influence remains pivotal. Last year, he did not drop a rubber, compiling a perfect 6-0 record — five wins in singles and one in doubles — on the country's march toward the title.

“Wearing the green and gold and honouring the greats who came before me has always been one of the greatest honours of my life,” he said in his acceptance speech, citing his 19-year tenure as a Davis Cup stalwart.Since retiring, Hewitt has become Australia's Davis Cup captain, leading the Aussies to back-to-back finals in 2022 and 2023. This year, the Aussies lost a narrow 3-2 tie in qualifying to an on-fire Belgium, who are into the semifinals of the Davis Cup Finals with another upset over France.Accepting a wild card into the Sydney Challenger in both singles and doubles, Cruz Hewitt won a round in the singles draw against former US Open junior champion Omar Jasika before losing in the second round.

He is one of eight men with a career Grand Slam, collecting eight championships at Wimbledon, six at the Australian Open, five at the US Open and one at the French Open."I didn't predict I was going to have this many majors," Federer once said in an interview with The Associated Press. "I was hoping to maybe have one, to be quite honest, at the very beginning of my career."Federer's first Slam title came at the All England Club in 2003, and he broke Pete Sampras' then-record for a male of 14 major titles by winning Wimbledon in 2009, defeating Andy Roddick 16-14 in the fifth set of the final. Federer claimed his 20th at the 2018 Australian Open."I don't really feel like I'm playing for the records," Federer once told the AP.

Along the way, Federer established himself as a model for younger athletes such as Carlos Alcaraz, 22, the current No. 1 who owns six Slam trophies."The elegance he has shown on court, off the court — how he treated people, everyone; a really humble guy — everything he does, he does with elegance," Alcaraz said. "I appreciate that. He took the game to another level ... that's what I admire the most."At the height of his powers, Federer reached a record 10 consecutive Grand Slam finals from 2005-07, winning eight. That dominance extended to appearing in 18 of 19 Slam finals; he also put together streaks of 23 semifinals and 36 quarterfinals at majors.Djokovic has called those "results that didn't seem human."According to the Hall, Carillo was the first woman to regularly commentate on tennis broadcasts and was a correspondent for HBO's "Real Sports." She won six Emmy Awards and three Peabody Awards and was inducted into the Sports Broadcasting Hall of Fame in 2018."I've been privileged to spend my career sharing the stories of this magnificent game," Carillo said, "and if I've opened any doors along the way, it will make this day in August even more meaningful."Next year's ballot will include holdovers Juan Martin del Potro and Svetlana Kuznetsova in the player category, while Serena Williams and Ash Barty, who both played their last matches in 2022, will be eligible for the Hall for the first time.

“I just feel like I've known guys like Lee my whole life.”

Ethan Hawke, the actor behind Lee Raybon on FX's “The Lowdown,” told IndieWire he immediately recognized the self-titled “truthstorian” in creator Sterlin Harjo's new Tulsa noir. He knew him the second he read the first script, and he just fell deeper and deeper into the character throughout shooting the first season.  

“It's not a far reach to see a guy who runs a used bookstore as a shadow self of the same part of me that wanted to start a theater company in the early '90s,” Hawke said during an interview for IndieWire's Pass the Remote panel series. “The positive side of that is he's really aligned with his youthful idealism. The negative [side] is he's, you know, a man-child. And I relate to that. I flat-out relate to that — to the stupidity of it and the beauty of it.”

Hawke is quick to credit Harjo for creating such a vivid, authentic character, just as he's eager to share credit with a “magic” crew of talented artists. 



“He's got this band of players down in Tulsa who are magic, and they're all believers in the same dream,” Hawke said. “I saw it when I went to work on ‘Reservation Dogs,' and I was like, ‘Aw, I want to be a part of this band. These guys are cool. They're renegades. They're mavericks and outlaws, and they can manage that sweet spot of having an incredibly good time while working really hard.'”

Tafv Sampson fits that bill. The show's set decorator, who also worked on “Reservation Dogs,” described what went into building two of Lee's essential spaces: a used bookstore he owns and the tiny room upstairs that serves as his apartment. 

“When we're trying to create these spaces, his bookstore is his kingdom and his apartment is a little bit of what's going on in his mind — his chaos, his way of thinking, his way of working,” Sampson said. “But it's also trying to be somewhat of a haven for his daughter.”

To shed a little more light on Lee's identity, the crew would swap out Lee's sheets depending on who was there. If Francis (Ryan Kiera Armstrong) was sleeping over, they'd used a “sweet, '90s-looking horse pillowcase that might look like something she'd have from childhood.” Whereas if Lee was alone, he'd use a “screen-printed, punk-looking T-shirt as a pillowcase.” 



“It's him attempting to be fatherly and paternal and make a cozy space, but clearly he's in the throes of his own chaotic life, too,” Sampson said.

Those details may not even be visible in shots, but they go a long way toward fleshing out a character who has to be a flesh-and-blood human being and a living legend.

“For me, set dec — especially things like your character's apartment — when that smells wrong, [it's a problem,]” Hawke said. “When I saw that bookstore, it smelled like a real bookstore to me. That makes Lee live in a three-dimensional landscape. It becomes a lot easier.”

“We're hoping that aesthetically [fans] can smell that [bookstore,]” Sampson said, adding that the crew built Lee's Hoot Owl Books from the ground up — lowering the ceiling, raising the floor, and hand-selecting every book that went on the shelves. 

“He's a little punk about who he wants in his store and who he doesn't want in his store,” Sampson said. “Lee is based on a real guy who worked at a real rare bookstore, so we got in touch with his coworker, and he became a very, very good friend to the production. […] We'd spend hours with him going through boxes and boxes of books. We would say, ‘This is something Lee would have in there, and here's why.' Because we want the cast and the crew to be able to walk into the store, pull any book off the shelf, and it would make sense that it's there. We're not going to have a Danielle Steele section in Lee's bookstore.” 



The plan worked a little too well, when actual Tulsa residents would spot the bookstore and walk inside, excited to discover a new bookseller in town. 

“The thing that makes those places so good is the sort of organized chaos,” Sampson said, “because the people running it have a brain similar to Lee. There's always a section that would never be a section at a normal bookstore, like ‘Woody Guthrie's Fever Dream' section — these things that are totally made-up but make sense to Lee.”

“All of a sudden, everything started to lock in,” Hawke said. “I didn't even have to look over my shoulder. I hit the ground running with this guy.”

Watching “The Lowdown,” you can tell. Down to Earth and larger than life at the same time, Lee Raybon has all the elements of an iconic character. Hawke may have seen him from the start, but it took a whole team of magicians to put the pieces together.

FX's “The Lowdown” Season 1 is available in full on Hulu.

EXCLUSIVE: J.K. Rowling has today made her first visit to the set of HBO‘s Harry Potter series.


	Sources tell Deadline that the author inspected progress on the adaptation of her beloved fantasy franchise, which has been filming at Warner Bros. Studios Leavesden and on location in the UK.


	One person joked that it was like receiving a royal visit, with senior members of the production team clearing space in their diaries to welcome Rowling. HBO declined to comment.


	Rowling serves as an executive producer on the Harry Potter series, and has contributed to writing and casting decisions on the show, which went into production over the summer.

	In June, Rowling said she had “worked closely with the extremely talented writers” on Harry Potter, not least showrunner Francesca Gardiner.




			Watch on Deadline		







	“I read the first two episodes of the forthcoming HBO Harry Potter series and they are SO, SO, SO GOOD,” she declared at the time.


	When the series was first announced in 2023, Rowling praised HBO's “commitment to preserving the integrity of my books,” adding: “I'm looking forward to being part of this new adaptation, which will allow for a degree of depth and detail only afforded by a long-form television series.”


	Rowling's views on transgender rights have been part of the discussion around the series, with HBO's Casey Bloys standing four-square behind its partnership with the author.


	Rowling herself has been clear that she has not allowed politics to interfere with casting decisions after Paapa Essiedu, who will play Severus Snape on the HBO series, voiced support for trans rights.

	











	“I don't believe in taking away people's jobs or livelihoods because they hold legally protected beliefs that differ from mine,” Rowling said on X/Twitter.


	Filming has been ongoing for months on the Harry Potter series, which will star Dominic McLaughlin as the titular Hogwarts wizard. Alastair Stout will play Harry's best friend Ron Weasley, and Arabella Stanton will round out the trio of heroes as bookworm Hermione Granger.


	Other cast includes Nick Frost as Rubeus Hagrid, John Lithgow as Albus Dumbledore, and Janet McTeer as Professor McGonagall. Gardiner and Mark Mylod write and direct respectively.

Amanda Seyfried already has an idea of how to bring Sabrina Carpenter and Sydney Sweeney into the Mamma Mia 3 storyline.


	Although a sequel to the jukebox musical has not been officially greenlit, Seyfried is hopeful that it will happen and has proposed that Carpenter and Sweeney join the cast.


	“Maybe I'm just naive, but I'm pretty sure Mamma Mia 3 is a done deal,” Seyfried told Entertainment Tonight at the Governors Awards.


Mamma Mia! was released in 2008, the film directed by Phyllida Lloyd and written by Catherine Johnson, is based on her book from the 1999 musical of the same name. A sequel to the movie released in 2018 was a prequel and Seyfried thinks the third film should focus on her character Sophie as a mother.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	“I love portraying a mom, so I would love to see Sophie with her kids,” Seyfried said. “Maybe she has a cousin she hasn't seen in a while, and that could be Sabrina Carpenter. And then Sydney Sweeney could show up. There's a bunch of girls that really want to be a part of it, and I'm all for it.”


	Seyfried noted that she just knew “the three dads are going to come back, and we still won't know who the dad is because it doesn't matter,” adding, “Meryl [Streep] is a ghost, obviously, so she'll be around. And Julie [Walters] and Christine [Baranski] will be back singing and looking hot, and we're all going to be somewhere tropical. And ABBA will be playing.”


	Seyfried has been keen on the idea of Carpenter joining her in the third Mamma Mia! film, after fans cast the “Please Please Please” singer as her daughter.


	“If Sabrina Carpenter wants to play my daughter, I'll make it happen. It's fine. I'm a big fan,” Seyfried told ABC News on October 2024.

EXCLUSIVE: Taika Waititi has closed a new first-look deal with 20th Television, FX Productions and Hulu — all divisions of Disney where he has a long history, both on the TV and the feature side.


	Under the pact, he will develop and direct original series for 20th Television and FX Productions targeting  all linear networks and streamers with priority given to Disney Entertainment Television platforms, most notably FX and Hulu.


	Waititi is currently in development with Barry writer-producer Jason Kim on Last Look, a half-hour comedy for Hulu from 20th Television. Written and executive produced by Waititi and Kim, Last Look is a modern upstairs/downstairs comedy set in a luxury fashion house. It depicts the lives of the underdogs who work tirelessly to make the fashions come to life – and the fabulous monsters who design them.

	











	Additionally, Waititi has in contention the FX pilot Very Young Frankenstein from 20th Television, which he directed and executive produced. Initial reaction to the pilot, based on Mel Brooks‘ classic 1974 film Young Frankenstein, has been positive. It is now in post-production.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Waititi, who has renewed his previous first-look deal, was behind FX's What We Do In the Shadows and Reservation Dogs — both Outstanding Comedy Series Emmy nominees (What We Do In the Shadows four times), and Hulu's Interior Chinatown.


	He also directed an episode of Disney+'s The Mandalorian. On the film side, his Disney credits include Marvel's Thor: Love and Thunder and Thor: Ragnarok and Searchlight's Jojo Rabbit, which earned him an Oscar for writing, and Next Goal Wins. Waititi is also writing and will direct a Star Wars film for Lucasfilm. He recently directed A Disney Holiday Short: Best Christmas Ever for Disney, which has garnered 34M views on YouTube alone since its Nov. 10 release. You can watch it below.


	Last year, Waititi launched Waititi Productions, led by Ishi Metkar, VP of Development and Production, and Michelle Chan, Director of Development and Production. The company is dedicated to producing film and television projects that spotlight voices and stories often overlooked by Hollywood — especially those from working-class backgrounds and rural or underrepresented parts of the world.

	











	Waititi, who has the Sony feature Klara And the Sun set for 2026 release, is repped by CAA, Manage-ment, and Yorn Levine Barnes.

EXCLUSIVE: Director Josh Ruben got off on the right foot early this year, releasing his Screen Gems romantic slasher Heart Eyes to critical acclaim. And now as the year winds down, Ruben has found his next project, attaching to direct the horror film Wilderness Reform for Paramount Pictures.


	Based on the 2024 novel by Harrison Query and Matt Query (Old Country), Wilderness Reform is about a wilderness camp for troubled teens that is plagued by mysterious events and disappearances, taking survival and discipline to a frightening extreme.


	Lindsey Beer will produce through her production company Lab Brew, which has a first-look deal with the studio, alongside Scott Glassgold through his 12:01 Films. Ruben will oversee a script draft by Steve Desmond and Michael Sherman, the scribes behind M. Night Shyamalan's Knock at the Cabin.

	Grossing over $33 million worldwide upon its pre-Valentine's Day release, and currently streaming on Netflix, Ruben's Heart Eyes stars Olivia Holt and Mason Gooding as a pair of coworkers who find themselves on the run on Valentine's Day, fleeing a masked killer who targets couples and mistakes them for lovers.


	Prior to Heart Eyes, Ruben directed a pair of horror comedies released by IFC. The most recent was Werewolves Within, starring Sam Richardson and Milana Vayntrub, which premiered at the 2021 Tribeca Festival and won a Midseason Hollywood Critics Association Award for Best Indie. Prior to that, he made his feature directorial debut with Scare Me, a critically acclaimed indie where he starred opposite Aya Cash and Chris Redd, which premiered at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival. As an actor, Ruben has also been seen on the Dropout series Make Some Noise, as well as in Season 1 of Shudder/AMC+'s The Creep Tapes opposite Mark Duplass. He is repped by CAA, Artists First, Empirical, and Ginsburg Daniels Kallis.


	Lab Brew is the production company of Beer, a filmmaker whose recent directorial debut, Pet Semetary: Bloodlines, which she also wrote, debuted as the number 1 title on Paramount+ and quickly broke the streamer's record for the most-watched Paramount+ Original Movie. Previously, Beer also wrote and executive produced Sierra Burgess Is a Loser, a modern-day retelling of Cyrano de Bergerac starring Noah Centineo and Shannon Purser that debuted #1 worldwide on Netflix. Other upcoming projects for the company include American Girl with Mattel Films and Paramount Pictures; Hello Kitty, which she wrote and is exec producing for New Line; Sleepy Hollow, which she will write, direct and produce for Paramount; a darker reimagining of The Munsters for television with James Wan, entitled 1313; and an adaptation of the novel Autumn Springs with Tango. Beer is repped by WME, Brillstein, and Gang, Tyre, Ramer.

	











	Glassgold's 12:01 Films has had a powerful impact on the marketplace since launching in December 2024, setting up one hot package after another based creator-driven IP, including many a short story. He secured the first major sale of the year with After Shock, a Brandon Sklenar earthquake pic set up at Lionsgate, before going on to set up Ripped with Dwayne Johnson, as well as python pic Crush at 20th, Fake Wedding with Lili Reinhart and Code Black with Jake Gyllenhaal at Amazon, Drift with Andy Muschietti at Skydance/Paramount, Earthling with Final Destination: Bloodlines‘ Zach Lipovsky & Adam Stein at Sony, and Fallen Astronaut at Apple. He's repped by Verve and McKuin Frankel Whitehead.

I've read the book, actually feels worthy of an adaptation. Love Rueben too. Let's see what new Paramount does with it

Could be a very cool project. Big fan of Ruben's last few movies and it will be fun to see him work with a teenage cast. Hopefully this gets Paramount one step closer to their “ambitious” slate goal.

I actually have high hopes for this. I was surprised how much I liked Heart Eyes. I think Ruben is one to watch. Beer is a smart and rare creative producer who actually does the work. Glassgold continues his winning streak. The Query brother authors are talented. Call me intrigued.

Jennifer Aniston's longtime best friend Adam Sandler gave a big thumbs up to her budding romance with Jim Curtis.

The “Happy Gilmore” actor publicly applauded Aniston's new relationship while presenting her with an award at Elle's 2025 Women in Hollywood Celebration on Monday.

“When we are around you, me and [my wife] Jackie are so happy you and Jim found each other and are having the love affair you two deserve,” Sandler, 59, joked before giving her boyfriend a shout-out.

“We love you, Jim,” he added.

The “Billy Madison” star went on to praise Aniston's incredible personality. 

“I can honestly say Jen is the best in so many ways and one of the most rocksteady humans I've ever met,” he said.

Sandler claimed he has only ever seen Aniston get angry “like, two and a half times” in the 40 years that they've known each other.

“Jennifer is beautiful, everyone knows that. She makes us smile and laugh. And she has a warmth to her that is intoxicating,” he said, concluding, “She is everyone's best friend.”

Sandler and Aniston have been close pals for years and co-starred in several projects together, including 2011's “Just Go With It,” 2019's “Murder Mystery” and 2023's “Murder Mystery 2.”

Aniston attended the star-studded event accompanied by the hypnotist — though he didn't walk the red carpet with her.

Instead, he was seen supporting her from inside the soirée held at the Four Seasons Hotel in Beverly Hills, Calif.

The “Friends” actress, 56, described Curtis' talents in an interview with Elle at the event.

“Hypnotism is one of the many things that he does. He's quite extraordinary, and helps many, many people,” Aniston said. 

“He's very special, very normal, and very kind, and wants to help people heal, move through their trauma and stagnation into clarity,” she added. “It's a beautiful thing to commit your life to.” 

Aniston and Curtis sparked dating rumors in July and went Instagram-official earlier this month.

			By Denise Petski, Nellie Andreeva 


Amazon MGM Studios has greenlighted another series based on popular MGM IP, giving a series order to Stargate for Prime Video. The new installment in the classic sci-fi franchise comes from Martin Gero, a Stargate veteran and veteran showrunner who created NBC's Blindspot. 


Stargate was among the first MGM titles identified for series or film adaptations following Amazon's $8.5B acquisition of the storied Hollywood studio in 2022. The series pickup follows series orders for Elle, a Legally Blonde prequel series from the film franchise's star Reese Witherspoon; Tomb Raider, headlined by Sophie Turner; and Barbershop, starring Jermaine Fowler, based on the MGM movies. Other series, such as Poltergeist, are in development.

	Gero will serve as creator, writer, executive producer and showrunner of Stargate. Executive producers also include Joby Harold and Tory Tunnell for Safehouse Pictures (Obi-Wan Kenobi, Monarch: Legacy of Monsters) as well as Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich, the duo behind the 1994 Stargate movie. Brad Wright and Joe Mallozzi, longtime creative leaders within the Stargate TV universe, will serve as consulting producers.

	“Twenty years ago, my first real job in television was as a Story Editor on Stargate: Atlantis. I spent five years at the franchise working across all three series, Stargate taught me everything about making television — it's written into my DNA,” said Gero. “I'm beyond thrilled that Amazon MGM Studios has entrusted me with guiding this incredible franchise into its next phase. For those who've kept the gate active through conventions, rewatches, and unwavering faith — this one's for you.  And for those that are new to our world — I promise you're in for something extraordinary.”


Stargate is a military sci-fi franchise that centers on the Stargate, an ancient ring-shaped device that creates a stable wormhole, enabling near-instantaneous travel across the cosmos.

	











	Originally launched with Emmerich's 1994 feature film Stargate, the franchise has expanded over three decades to include multiple television series including Stargate SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate Atlantis (2004-2009), and Stargate Universe (2009-2011). Other series include the animated Stargate Infinity (2002-2003) and web series Stargate Origins (2018).


	“Stargate is an enduring, iconic franchise that has captivated audiences for decades with its bold exploration of humanity's place in the cosmos,” said Nick Pepper, Head of US SVOD TV Development, Amazon MGM Studios. “In partnership with our extraordinary creative team of Martin, Tory, and Joby, we're honored to open this next gate to bring a visionary new chapter of this beloved franchise to our global Prime Video audience, one that honors the series' rich legacy while propelling it into an ambitious and emotionally resonant future.”


	This marks one of the first new series greenlights since Peter Friedlander was named Head of Global TV for Amazon MGM Studios at the end of September. 


	Gero created and served as executive producer on Blindspot, which aired for five seasons on NBC. He most recently served as executive producer and showrunner on both seasons of Quantum Leap, also for NBC. His other series credits include Kung Fu, Dark Matter and Bored To Death. In addition to Stargate: Atlantis he served as writer-producer on Stargate Universe and Stargate SG-1. Gero is repped by TFC Management and Ziffren Brittenham.

The world is a very very different place than in 2010. I can't even begin to imagine how you'd either diverge the SG setting from ours, or how you'd have such a light tone and have to make it feel appropriate

Richard Dean Anderson!

I've watched enough television to know that I'd rather be surprised these days, rather than spoonfed every little detail in advance. That's why I stopped watching movie trailers. 

However, I'd be curious to know how the Stargates were made. Ra and the other parasitic “gods” didn't create them, just took the credit…

Is this a reboot?

I'm so excited for this!!!

Palme d'Or-winning filmmaker Jafar Panahi, who is now able to move freely out of his home country of Iran, is set to go on “tour” in the United States for the first time.

After 15 years of being subjected to imprisonment, interrogation, and house arrest, Panahi made it to the New York Film Festival earlier this fall after last-minute visa issues were resolved. Now, he'll embark on a six-city trip across the U.S., as IndieWire exclusively shares, a first in his four-decade career making films (and often, recently, in secret). Stops will include New York, Los Angeles, Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, and Seattle, where Panahi will visit the storied arthouse cinemas in each city — all while crafting a new short film to document his journey. It's set for release early next year.

Since winning the Palme d'Or at Cannes and emerging as France's official entry to the 98th Academy Awards, it has collected prizes and tributes around the world — with stops in Africa, Australia, Asia, and North and South America. Panahi has been honored by top festivals and filmmakers, including Claire Denis, Giuseppe Tornatore, and Martin Scorsese.

Kate Winslet appeared on “Jimmy Kimmel Live” on Tuesday night to discuss her directorial debut, but ended up divulging the questionable look she wore to meet King Charles III decades ago.

Harking back to the 1996 premiere of “Sense and Sensibility,” Winslet shared, “The first time I met him. Oh my goodness. He had come to support the royal premiere of ‘Sense and Sensibility' when I was only 20.”

For the occasion, she wore a totally sheer black lace jumpsuit with flat black sandals and a black coat.

“I sort of hadn't realized we were really going to meet him. So I forgot about the fact that I really was wearing a kind of transparent lace outfit,” she laughed, adding, “And thank God I'd worn a coat because as he's making his way towards me, I'm like, ‘Nipples! Nipples! Nipples! Oh, my God.' And then someone just went, ‘Coat!' and [I covered myself] and went, ‘Your Majesty.'”

The actress had many more opportunities to choose outfits better-suited to meet the Royals; this summer, she became one of the Ambassadors for The King's Foundation, which “supports small charities and crafts that have been outdated.”

For last night's show, Winslet chose a more tailored black and white pinstriped suit with stiletto heels, though she nearly had a wardrobe malfunction — she confessed that she tripped walking out of her dressing room, on her way to the stage.

Die-hard Winslet fans might make a connection to one of the most iconic “Titanic” looks, when Rose DeWitt Bukater wears a white pinstriped coat when we are first introduced to the character, though in the inverse colorway, 

Winslet is on a press tour for the movie “Goodbye June,” which was written by her son, Joe Anders.

Now nearly 22, Anders wrote the film when he was 19, pulling from his own family dynamics when his family came together upon the death of his grandmother, Winslet's mother.

Winslet is the film's director, a producer and also has an acting role in the movie. It is the first feature film directed by the 56-year-old, making it a milestone moment for both Winslet and her son.

Lifeguard have announced a new maxi-single that's coming out next year. “Ultra Violence” / “Appetite” features 11 songs in a speedy 13 minutes, and will be out both digitally and as a limited 7" vinyl on Matador. The record opens with the new song “Ultra Violence,” which Lifeguard are sharing today. Give that a listen below.

The “Ultra Violence” / “Appetite” 7" is available for pre-order through Matador until January 13.Recorded in the band's own studio Stulogulo by plugging straight into an 8-track machine, the new maxi-single also features dub effects, the sounds of dirty mixing pots, and Echoplexes. In a press release, the band call it “the fully deterritorialized Ripped and Torn; the ripping and tearing of the band-aid.”

The Chicago-based rock and post-punk trio—featuring singer-guitarist Kai Slater, singer-bassist Asher Case, and drummer Isaac Lowenstein—released its debut album, Ripped and Torn, earlier this year, and the group is currently on tour supporting Bar Italia. Lifeguard will stay on the road with the British indie-rockers through the end of November, with upcoming dates booked in Boston, Montreal, Toronto, and elsewhere.

Outside of Lifeguard, Kai Slater makes music as Sharp Pins. He shared Radio DDR earlier this year, and, on Friday, drops Balloon Balloon Balloon.

Jake Owen was one of the architects of bro country, churning out radio smashes like “Barefoot Blue Jean Night” and “The One That Got Away.” But on his new album of outlaw country songs, Dreams to Dream, he all but buries his party-friendly persona.


	“A lot of my music, as an artist, has had a big fucking curtain right in front of it. It's like fantasyland. There's not been a lot of full honesty. And those songs worked for me, and they work for a lot of people,” Owen tells Rolling Stone's Nashville Now podcast in a vulnerable, remarkably emotional interview. 


	“My favorite artists of all time, whether it be Hank Williams Jr., Merle Haggard, Waylon, all their songs that were the most honest and let you behind the curtain is why you loved them as an artist,” he continues. “The truth in this album was in addressing my feelings.”


	Owen teamed up with Grammy-winning producer Shooter Jennings to record Dreams to Dream and says they bonded over Hank Williams Jr. One particular song by Bocephus spoke to him. In reciting the lyrics to “Feelin' Better,” off 1977's The New South — “had to get high so I wouldn't cry/you know they hit pretty close to home” — Owen breaks down.

	“Every time I say this I well up inside,” Owen says through fits of tears. “If it didn't feel this way, I would just be able to wipe it away and keep rocking down this story. But it does hurt, man.”

	A major scoop about a foiled plot to bomb a Florida synagogue on a Jewish holiday by Tren de Aragua gang members who were also sex trafficking minors has been rocketing across right-wing media for a month.


	Pro-Israel news outlets like Anash, Ynet, and Israel National News, influencers like Libs of TikTok, Fox News reporters, and even a conservative commentator on CNN repeated the claim, which was first published by right-wing activist group Project Veritas. “The Brazilian nationals, linked to Tren de Aragua, face charges of underage sex trafficking and planning a terrorist attack on Chabad South Orlando, a Jewish synagogue and school,” Project Veritas posted on Oct. 11, with mug shots of the two culprits as seeming corroboration of the wild claims.


	The almost-too-crazy-to-be-true story, however, appears to be the fabrication of a serial forger, fabulist, and federal fugitive allegedly holed up in a Mexico hotel, on the run from the FBI in a major fraud case. The way the flimsy story was filtered through the right-wing news ecosystem is a stark example of how fake news manufactured out of almost nothing can go viral, if it hits the right topical key words and emotional triggers.

	











	There's no actual evidence of a criminal investigation into this sinister plot: Experts say the narrative is implausible, and the U.S. attorney's office where this allegedly took place confirmed to Rolling Stone that the two Brazilians identified by Project Veritas are simply on their way to a routine deportation for immigration violations, and that no criminal charges are forthcoming. The only part of the Project Veritas story Rolling Stone could corroborate is that the two Brazilians were indeed taken into custody, but into ICE immigration custody on immigration holds.

	So how could a largely false story from a well-known fraudster and forger make it all the way to CNN?


	Project Veritas, the activist group founded and formerly run by James O'Keefe known for deceptive undercover videos, has been publishing stories featuring a Brazilian national named Patricia Lélis Bolin for several months now, promoting her bizarre conspiracy theories involving more than a dozen people, including former Attorney General Bill Barr, Georgia prosecutor Fani Willis, the CIA, and Qatar, as well as the federal prosecutor in her own fraud case. Bolin was indicted last year in the Eastern District of Virginia (EDVA) for bilking fellow Brazilian immigrants out of $700,000 by pretending to be an immigration attorney, fabricating entire personas, and forging documents, and is currently wanted by the FBI, with a warrant out for her arrest.

	People from across the political spectrum have for years denied Bolin's stories about them and called her a liar, from Trump operative Jason Miller, to conservative talk show host Armstrong Williams, to former congressman George Santos, to MAGA publicist Trevian Kutti, who was indicted by Fani Willis for her role in the Georgia election interference case. Kutti, like others, first promoted some of Bolin's claims against their common enemies, before deciding that Bolin was untrustworthy and her materials were forgeries.


	Bolin also has a long history of alleged forgeries and elaborate accusations in her home country of Brazil. She was indicted there for making a false accusation against former Brazilian lawmaker Eduardo Bolsonaro, the son of former president Jair Bolsonaro, producing threatening Telegram messages that Brazilian police determined were not authentic. Bolin has even been accused of editing herself into a photograph of a mother and a newborn baby to pretend she had given birth to a special needs child.


	But all of this hasn't stopped Project Veritas from relying on Bolin's elaborate accusations. The group's storifes featuring Bolin include alleged texts, WhatsApp messages, and emails that share far-fetched wording, forensic irregularities, and mistakes — such as a person alleged to be Fani Willis spelling her own first name wrong (as “Fabi”) in text messages.

	In October, Project Veritas posted new “leaked texts” allegedly between two EDVA prosecutors, Michael Ben'Ary and Russell Carlberg, discussing their hatred of Trump. Ben'Ary became a target of Trump supporters after he slammed the DOJ for persecuting Trump's enemies, and was fired for allegedly refusing to participate in weaponized prosecutions days before Project Veritas shared the supposed text conversation.

	











	Carlberg, to whom Ben'Ary was supposedly texting his desire for Trump to die, happens to be the lead prosecutor on Bolin's own fraud case.


	The texts showed the same hallmarks as the ones Project Veritas shared in August promoting Bolin's conspiracy theory that Bill Barr orchestrated a scheme with Fani Willis and Jack Smith to criminally prosecute Trump. In both cases, the cell phone number appears above several of the sender's texts, normally only seen in group text conversations on iPhone. The screenshots also show a FaceTime icon while the iPhone is using its text message service, not iMessage.


	Bill Marczak, a senior research fellow at Citizen Lab who has served as an expert technology witness in cybersecurity criminal cases, says it's virtually impossible for iPhone messages to appear this way. “My suspicion is that the screenshots have been manipulated,” or created with an app, he says, having reviewed the screenshots shared by Project Veritas.


	Bolin also posted, and deleted, screenshots of threatening WhatsApp messages she claimed Carlberg sent her just one week before Project Veritas posted Carlberg's alleged texts with Ben-Ary. Both Bolin and Project Veritas have denied that Bolin was the source of the EDVA “leaked” texts. 


	Four days after the EDVA “leak,” on Oct. 11, Project Veritas shared more leaked texts — and these were wilder than ever. “Project Veritas evidence sparks FBI raid & arrest of two illegal immigrants,” text imposed over screenshots of iPhone text messages and two mug shots read. The texts purport to be between a Brazilian couple, Janaina de Toledo and Leonardo Corona Ramos, and a 16-year-old they appear to want to sex traffic. The texts show improbably explicit planning of crimes — ”I think 6 explosives will be enough. I can't believe we're so close to wiping out those damn Jews” — as well as the same repeating phone number that appears in screenshots used for other Project Veritas stories featuring Bolin.


	Toledo and Ramos are longtime enemies of Bolin. Toledo and Bolin have battled for years over social media, and brought lawsuits against each other in Brazil. Bolin even maintains a Google Drive with 31 folders and over a gigabyte of data tracking the couple's movements over the last several years that she shares on her social media.

	At first, few influencers repeated the Project Veritas claims, with the exception of Libs of TikTok, which repeated it that night. But when pro-Israel news outlets picked the story up the next day, and reported that the unverifiable claims from Project Veritas actually came from federal authorities, more right-wing influencers began spreading the story.

	











	Some of the news stories were not bylined. Israel National News wrote in an unbylined story: “The FBI and the Florida police revealed on Sunday that they recently arrested two men suspected of planning a serious attack against the Chabad House in Orlando, Florida, motivated by antisemitism. The arrest was carried out in the midst of Sukkot. American authorities claim that the [sic] could have been among the most serious terrorist incidents in the country's history.” Other details in the story that seemingly only come from Project Veritas are attributed to “investigators.”


	“The suspects are expected to be brought to trial before a federal court in Florida on serious charges, including conspiracy to commit a terrorist attack, membership in a foreign terrorist organization, and unlawful presence in the United States,” Israel National News wrote.


	Israel National News did not reply to emailed questions.


	A reporter on one bylined story, in Ynet, didn't answer messages from Rolling Stone asking if they had indeed gotten any information from federal authorities. “The two face charges including human trafficking, including trafficking children for sexual exploitation, and conspiracy to commit a terrorist attack against the Chabad in south Orlando,” they reported on Oct. 12.


	But the news outlets' perceived credibility nonetheless furthered the story's spread among right-wing influencers and pundits. “Crazy this isn't a bigger story,” Fox News and New York Post columnist Karol Markowicz wrote. The X account Stop Antisemitism and pro-Israel influencer Eyal Yakoby also shared the story. “It appears Project Veritas stopped a massive terrorist attack with their investigation. Incredible,” Robby Starbuck, a visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation, wrote. Influencer posts amplifying the story received millions of views on X. 


	The next day the story got air time on CNN, on The Lead With Jake Tapper. “There was a story out of Florida that just broke, I believe, either Thursday or Friday of two individuals who are in the country illegally who were planning a terrorist attack against a Jewish synagogue, against a shabbat dinner,” CNN conservative political commentator Shermichael Singleton said on the show. “And you know who broke that story? This is a name you don't hear often on CNN, Project Veritas, of all places.”


	Neither the guest host standing in for Tapper nor the Democrat commentator on the panel with Singleton questioned the claims. Project Veritas then featured the CNN clip in an X post about the story. CNN did not respond to an email.

	











	But a month after Project Veritas' initial post, it appears the couple are not actually being investigated for the serious crimes of planning a terror attack and sex trafficking minors. There is no evidence the FBI has commented on the allegations, no criminal charges have emerged, and Florida police would not confirm they were involved. A spokesperson for the Middle District of Florida U.S. attorney's office confirmed to Rolling Stone that the two Brazilians are in ICE custody being processed for removal and that there are no additional criminal investigations or indictments coming. After being briefly held on an immigration hold in Orlando jail, they were both moved to separate ICE detention facilities in Florida, with Ramos currently at Alligator Alcatraz, and Toledo in Arizona, according to Rolling Stone's monitoring of their detention on the ICE website.


	Messages from Ramos' mother and his attorney — who specializes in routine immigration issues, not criminal defense — viewed by Rolling Stone also indicate that the two were detained only on immigration charges, not criminal charges, and that they expect them to be deported to Brazil soon. Ramos' attorney told Rolling Stone Ramos could be deported to Brazil this week.


	Simply deporting alleged gang members suspected of a hate crime terror plot and underage sex trafficking, rather than criminally prosecuting them here in the U.S., is exceedingly unlikely, experts tell Rolling Stone.


	Georgia attorney Eli Bennett specializes in defending clients with both criminal and immigration status legal issues. “It would be pretty unheard of for the feds to just process someone for deportation if they suspected them of those serious crimes,” he says. “I'd also expect something to be on a public docket by this point, or for the FBI to make a big announcement showing off that they stopped this major crime from happening.”


	Former federal prosecutor Ken White agrees. “If they ‘face charges of underage sex trafficking and planning a terrorist attack on Chabad South Orlando, a Jewish synagogue and school,' as Project Veritas claims, they would not be left in ICE custody,” he says.


	“Aside from the real risk ICE would deport them (one hand often not knowing what the other hand is doing), ICE custody is less secure in terms of them interacting with other conspirators in custody,” White adds. “If there were a prosecution, they would be in U.S. Marshal custody. I would expect the feds would have charged them — perhaps first in a complaint — and gotten custody of them. The notion that you'd leave a suspected terrorist hanging out in ICE custody on the chance you might pick them up later is absolutely not credible, even for this administration.”

	











	Project Veritas and Bolin separately claimed that Orlando police and the FBI were involved in a raid on the Orlando hotel where Toledo and Ramos were staying. That week, Bolin posted several celebratory TikToks, detailing how she helped find the pair's location, even doing a gleeful dance recounting the arrests, and taking credit for the bust of her longtime adversaries. 


	Project Veritas also took credit for the couple's arrest: “The group's investigative journalists uncovered evidence that sparked an FBI raid on October 11, 2025, thwarting what authorities call one of Florida's largest potential terrorist attacks in history,” the group wrote on its website, adding that the text messages they posted spurred “law enforcement [to] obtain a federal search warrant, leading to an immediate raid on the suspects' hotel rooms that revealed further details of the imminent plot.” 


	Before the immigration arrest, Toledo messaged a friend in Brazil expressing her fear that Bolin was tracking them down in Orlando, in WhatsApp messages viewed by Rolling Stone. Toledo was also in contact with an FBI agent on Bolin's case earlier this year, sending him information about a Mexico City hotel where Toledo believed Bolin was hiding. “Thank you for the updated information — it is appreciated,” the agent wrote in an April email viewed by Rolling Stone.


	But only several months later, Bolin, a wanted FBI fugitive, claimed that she herself was orchestrating an FBI raid of sex traffickers and would-be Chabad terror bombers. “We started investigating everything this


	woman was involved in. It took a significant amount of time, a really long time. We collaborated closely with the local police in Florida, right, in the county where she's located. And we also collaborated closely with the FBI. And well, she ended up being arrested,” Bolin said in Portuguese in a video she posted to TikTok.


	The Orlando police department did not confirm they were involved in the arrests, and instead referred inquiries about the arrests to the FBI or ICE. The FBI did not respond to inquiries, and ICE was unable to provide information about the case in time for publication.


	Project Veritas sent a statement to Rolling Stone: “Patricia Lelis Bolin is a whistleblower whom Project Veritas has published four individual reports with, exposing many public figures for alleged illegal activity. That is our relationship with Ms. Bolin.” In response to questions about the source of their claims regarding the terror plot, the group wrote that “a journalist never reveals their sources” and accused us of asking “unethical questions.”

	











	Bolin said in a written statement: “I am happy to know that you are following my case and keeping an eye on what the EDVA, Bill Barr, and Armstrong Williams has tried to do to me and my family. Please stay tuned as a lot more is coming and I'd be happy to give you a heads up before we publish.”


	She added: “I hope you do better research on Janaina de Toledo and Leonardo Corona. I am not the only person for whom a judge granted a protective order because of the harassment they were carrying out. Any defamation or baseless accusation attempting to claim that I produced messages or that I am Veritas source will be subject to legal action.”


	It's unclear why Project Veritas would run stories featuring such a dubious source as Bolin, but the stories fit the group's pattern of publishing pieces targeting figures who oppose Trump. Bolin's long list of enemies include the prosecutors who indicted her, who also work out of a U.S. attorney's Office that Trump supporters were angry with for its resistance to Trump's weaponization of the DOJ. 


	Project Veritas rose to prominence while headed by James O'Keefe for its hidden camera videos that claimed to catch liberals in instances of bias or wrongdoing. O'Keefe was forced out of the group in 2023, accused by the board of financial malfeasance. Benjamin Wetmore, the board director appointed soon after — who has his own connections to some of O'Keefe's most notorious stunts — remains in charge. Wetmore was previously an attorney for a Texas group run by an O'Keefe associate that employed similar hidden camera stunts in Texas. He was also implicated in O'Keefe's infamous 2010 stunt to attempt to “seduce” CNN reporter Abbie Boudreau on a boat. Wetmore recently called himself not only the board director at Veritas, but an “investigative journalist” for the group.


	Courtney Hagle, a research director at media watchdog group Media Matters, has been tracking Project Veritas since 2011. She says it's not surprising to see the group engage in deceptive and unethical practices: “Deception is their bread and butter, and there really isn't a line they won't cross when it comes to going after their ideological enemies. They often straddle the legal line, or stop short of illegality, but they've created fraudulent identities in the past and engaged in other unethical practices.”

	Hagle added that Project Veritas has experience “weaponizing media” and making mainstream media “take the bait,” by keeping a veneer of being a news outlet.“This recent example, in which it seems like they are reaching new lows, and being even more brazen than before, really shows how misinformation can spread so easily through bad actors,” she says.

	











	Project Veritas still has the Chabad terror “scoop” pinned to the top of their X profile, and they've been fundraising off the Bolin connected stories. “Project Veritas thwarts an Orlando terror attack! Support Project Veritas,” the group shared on a recent Instagram story, with a link to donate.

Ozzy Osbourne's rarely seen son Louis Osbourne reflected on the late rocker's funeral.

The Black Sabbath member's eldest son appeared on Jack Osbourne's “Trying Not to Die” podcast on Tuesday.

The half-siblings discussed the procession through Buckinghamshire, England, which took place in July.

Ozzy, notably, had passed away one week prior at age 76 after suffering a heart attack.

Louis told listeners how blown away he was by the “volume of people” who came to mourn the Grammy winner.

“Before we turned onto the street, I just thought it was going to be like two or three people deep for like half a kilometer before where the Black Sabbath bridge was, and it would be a throng,” he recalled.

However, the turnout was “f–king insane.”

Louis was “getting goosebumps thinking about” onlookers “climbing up lampposts, hanging out of windows, standing on top of bus stops to get a look of it.”

He continued, “Once we had all got out of the cars and showed our respects, and put some flowers down and moved on again, it kept on going for another half a mile and then people were following us all around town.”

He called the moment “kind of awe-inspiring,” explaining, “I knew people loved him, but I didn't have a sense of how many and how much.”

At the time, Louis was photographed honoring Ozzy, alongside Jack, Sharon Osbourne, Aimee Osbourne and Kelly Osbourne.

Ozzy welcomed Louis and Jessica, 53, with his ex-wife, Thelma Riley, before their 1982 split, also adopting the 71-year-old teacher's son Elliot from a previous romance.

Elliot did not appear to be present at the funeral.

Jessica and Elliot were left out of the family statement confirming Ozzy's death over the summer, which read, “It is with more sadness than mere words can convey that we have to report that our beloved Ozzy Osbourne has passed away this morning.

“He was with his family and surrounded by love. We ask everyone to respect our family privacy at this time.”

Louis's name was included in the singoff, and he paid additional tribute to his late father with a subtle social media move.

While the nature of Elliot's relationship with Ozzy remains unknown, Jessica was estranged from the musician before his passing.

Jessica claimed in the 2011 “God Bless Ozzy Osbourne” documentary that her childhood was “erratic” as her father would be “away for very long periods of time.”

EXCLUSIVE: Greenland and Fuze outfit Anton is teaming up with Cory Todd Hughes and Adrian Speckert of So It Goes Entertainment to develop a film adaptation of 2024 video game Chained Together.


	Developed by UK-outfit Anegar Games, Chained Together became a multiplayer hit when released last year. In the game, players must work together, chained to one another, to climb, survive, and escape perilous environments. Throughout the game, players can find ten power-ups, called Wings, that allow them to recover from falling. There's a hard mode, where lava constantly rises, or an easy mode, where there are checkpoints. The game was released on June 19, 2024, and gained 80,000 players within its first week of release.

	Todd Hughes and Speckert's writing credits include Sylvester Stallone 2024 action film Armor and Cole Sprouse 2025 action-thriller Under Fire. The duo have recently worked on the development of video game adaptations Finding Frankie, with Mortal Kombat exec-producer Sean Robins, and horror franchise Dark Deception.

	Anton's recent slate includes David Mackenzie thriller Fuze starring Theo James and Aaron Taylor-Johnson, which premiered at TIFF; and Oscar nominee, Memoir Of A Snail. Upcoming projects include sequel Greenland: Migration, starring Gerard Butler, scheduled for release January 9th 2026 via Lionsgate.


	“Chained Together is one of those games that instantly connects with players because of its humor, challenge, and sense of teamwork,” said Speckert and Hughes in a joint statement. “As producers, we couldn't be more excited to be working with Anton on this. We think they're the perfect partner for this project, and we believe there's an endless amount of fun to be had with the premise. The game's collaborative nature, the dependency between players chained together, creates a unique foundation for cinematic storytelling. We can't wait to bring that spirit to life for fans and new audiences alike.”

Millie Bobby Brown and Jake Bongiovi's daughter made a sweet cameo during the “Stranger Things” star's recent interview. 

The actress and co-star Noah Schnapp were playing with kittens while chatting with Buzzfeed on Monday when a baby could be heard crying in the background.

Brown, 21, kept scratching the cat in her lap as she confirmed to viewers, “That's my child. That's my kitten.”

The brief outburst marked the only cameo the little one made in the video.

The Emmy nominee and her husband, Jake, adopted their daughter in August.

Brown explained earlier this month that she plans to keep her daughter's name private “until she's old enough to potentially one day share it herself.”

“For me, it's really important to protect her and her story,” the new mom told British Vogue. “It's not my place to purposefully put her in the spotlight unwillingly.”

However, the “Enola Holmes” star noted, “If she chooses to share her personality one day with the world, like I did when I was young, that's something we'd support.”

Brown and Bongiovi, notably, did not share a photo of their infant when announcing her arrival over the summer.

“We are beyond excited to embark on this beautiful next chapter of parenthood in both peace and privacy,” the couple wrote via Instagram at the time.

Proud grandpa Bon Jovi told Bunnie XO the following month that his daughter-in-law and son, 23, are “mature beyond their years.”

During the September “Dumb Blonde” episode, the 63-year-old gushed, “I want to see pictures, like, every other day. I'm that pain in the butt guy already.”

Brown and Bongiovi have been married since May 2024.

They started dating in 2021 and got engaged one year before walking down the aisle in the Hamptons — and again in Italy.

Before starting their family, Brown spoke candidly on the “SmartLess” podcast about her desire to become a young mom.

“This has been my thing since before I met Jake,” she clarified to listeners in March.

There's no shortage of cinephile-baiting information available on just how damn good a movie year 1975 was (gaze upon our own list of the best films of the decade, many of them hailing from 1975), and Netflix recently noticed how special the year that gave us Steven Spielberg's “Jaws,” Mel Brooks' “Young Frankenstein,” and Francis Ford Coppola‘s Oscar-winning “The Godfather Part II” was, feting it with a special 1975-themed screening series earlier this year.

But that series, it seems, was only the beginning, as the streamer has announced today (and exclusive to IndieWire) the very fast-approaching release of its secret documentary essay film all about 1975. It hails from the Academy Award-winning documentarian Morgan Neville (“20 Feet From Stardom,” “Won't You Be My Neighbor,” and “Piece by Piece”) and is intriguingly titled “Breakdown: 1975.” Oh, and it's narrated by no less than Jodie Foster, bonafide “Taxi Driver” star.

And talking heads? You want some talking heads? Neville's film has them too, including Albert Brooks, Bill Gates, Ellen Burstyn, Frank Rich, James Risen, James Wolcott, Jefferson Cowie, Joan Tewkesbury, Josh Brolin, Kurt Andersen, Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs, Martin Scorsese, Naomi Fry, Oliver Stone, Patton Oswalt, Peter Bart, Peter Biskind, Rick Perlstein, Sam Wasson, Seth Rogen, Dr. Todd Boyd, and Wesley Morris.

 










Per the film's official logline: “In 1975, as America faced social and political upheaval, filmmakers turned chaos into art. This documentary explores how a turbulent era gave rise to iconic movies like ‘Taxi Driver,' ‘One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,' and ‘Network.'” 

Of the film, Neville told IndieWire, “At a time when the culture feels like it's breaking apart, film can be the thing that helps us make sense of it and feel like we're not crazy. There's no better illustration of this than the mid-1970s. It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. And it was funky.” 

Neville, as always, has been keeping busy. His other 2025 documentary “Man on the Run,” premiered earlier this year at Telluride. The Paul McCartney-focused film will be released in theaters on February 18, 2026 and will then drop on Prime Video for streaming on February 27. 

“Breakdown: 1975” will start streaming on Netflix on Friday, December 19, truly the perfect pre-holiday distraction for movie lovers of all kinds.

The competition is heating up on “Dancing with the Stars” Season 34. Last night's episode on Tuesday, November 18, was the semifinals, and the theme was Prince Night. The remaining six celebrity contestants competing for the Mirrorball Trophy all wowed with their dances, and as always, Mark Ballas and Whitney Leavitt delivered incredible performances! They danced not one but two routines, and impressed the judges with both. 

Leavitt wowed with her Cha Cha to “1999” and a Viennese Waltz to “Slow Love.” Her first dance was the Cha Cha, and judges Carrie Ann Inaba, Derek Hough, and Bruno Tonioli scored her a 29 out of 30. The second performance from Leavitt and Ballas was the Viennese Waltz. They scored 29 out of 30. This meant their total score on the night was 58 out of 60. 

Although they were not the highest-scoring couple of the evening, and that went to Robert Irwin and Witney Carson, they were at the top of the pack. Jordan Chiles and Ezra Sosa, Elaine Hendrix and Alan Bersten, and Dylan Efron and Daniella Karagach all had lower scores than Leavitt and Ballas. Ballas is an incredible dancer and choreographer, and Leavitt is a talented dancer who has continued to progress throughout the competition. She has never delivered a weak or mediocre performance, and yet, it was Ballas and Leavitt who were eliminated at the end of the semifinals. 

Fans have a mix of feelings: outrage, disappointment, heartbreak, and, for some, this was the right move because the other contestants' characters appealed to them more. The official “Dancing with the Stars” Instagram account posts updates about the dances minutes after they are performed. On posts of her dances, fans have flooded the comment section with their thoughts. 

“Whitney should've won it alllllll!!! Can't believe you guys sent her home. Best dancer on the show!” a comment reads. “Hey so you all robbed us of her talent in the finale,” another person shared. 

“I hope you bitter ladies are happy. We won't get to see the best dancer in the finale now,” a third fan wrote. 

Other reactions include, “This woman can dance, there is zero doubt about that. If we are purely speaking about dance skills, she's incredibly talented!! Also Mark always slays,” “She's the best female dancer idc. People wanting her to be voted off is actually insane,” and “IDC I VOTED FOR WHITNEY!!”

Jimmy Kimmel is delighted by Donald Trump‘s current lack chill about anything regarding Jeffrey Epstein. 


	“Trump is not a happy little meal right now,” Kimmel said on last night's episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live!. “Every time he gets asked about Jeffrey Epstein, he loses his mind.”


	Kimmel explained that the ongoing battle to release the Epstein files has sent Trump off the edge. Yesterday, Congress finally voted to share the files with the public, which seems to be rattling the president. “If anyone thinks he's going to release all the Epstein files I've got a beautiful East Wing of the White House to sell you,” Kimmel noted. 


	Over the past few days, Trump has been snapping at reporters when asked about Epstein. Kimmel played the now-viral clip of Trump on Air Force One on Friday, when he pointed at a female reporter and told her, “Quiet, piggy.”


	“He called her piggy,” Kimmel recounted. “He said ‘Quiet, piggy' to a reporter and it barely made the news. If a man spoke like that to a female co-worker in a workplace harassment training video, you'd go, ‘Ah, that's over the top. Nobody would do that.' If the pilot on Air Force One behaved like the president, he wouldn't be allowed to fly the plane.”

	











	“That was Friday,” Kimmel continued. “Today, Trump did what most people would do when faced with a scandal that could potentially end his presidency. He welcomed an evil prince to the White House.”


	The host described Tuesday's press event with Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. “This is a guy who gave a green light to the brutal murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a columnist for the Washington Post, who'd been critical of bin Salman's regime,” Kimmel said. “He was dismembered with a bone saw at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. So naturally, Trump is pulling out all the stops for his trillionaire friend, who also happens to be doing business with Don Jr. and Eric.”

	











	During the press event, Trump berated ABC News White House correspondent Mary Bruce after she asked him about Khashoggi‘s murder. Trump told her she shouldn't “embarrass” his guest by asking about the murder. “That's right,” Kimmel said. “How dare you embarrass a man who had a columnist sawed into pieces.” 


	After Bruce followed up with a question about Epstein, Trump called her a “terrible reporter” and threatened to have ABC's license taken away. “We have a great commissioner, the chairman, who should look at that,” Trump said.

	“I don't know,” Kimmel responded of Trump's reference to FCC chairman Brendan Carr, who pressured the network into suspending Jimmy Kimmel Live! earlier this year. “The last time your FCC guy looked at that, didn't go so great for you. It really didn't.”


	Kimmel concluded, “Say what you want about the Epstein files, but they've kind of brought the country together. We had an almost unanimous vote in Congress today. That hasn't happened for a long time.”

Ariana Grande appeared on The Tonight Show ahead of the arrival of Wicked: For Good and took the opportunity to showcase a brief history of famous duets with host Jimmy Fallon. 


	The duo rolled through a series of duets, including Wicked musical number “For Good,” Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell's Ain't No Mountain High Enough,” Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper's “Shallow,” and Brandy and Monica's “The Boy Is Mine.” Their performance spanned both Broadway and film, including animated flicks like Aladdin. They concluded with Bill Medley and Jennifer Warnes' “(I've Had) the Time of My Life.”


	Grande also sat down with Fallon to discuss Wicked: For Good, which in theaters Friday, and her upcoming slot hosting Saturday Night Live alongside musical guest Cher. “I'm so excited,” Grande said of SNL. “I didn't know it was going to be her until like two days before, and I found out and I almost passed out. I had no idea what to do. What an honor.” She added, “This is one of the gayest SNL episodes that has ever happened, right?”

	











	The singer reflected on making both Wicked films at the same time. “It was interesting to watch it so many years after we had finished because shot both simultaneously,” she said of the sequel. “So in my head they're both one story and one experience.” She added that she's “grateful” it was split into two movies because “you really get to know Glinda the way that I got to know her and to love her in order to play her.”

	After Wicked: For Good, Grande will prepare to head out on the road for her Eternal Sunshine tour, which will mark her first extended run of concert dates since 2019. But in a new interview on Amy Poehler‘s Good Hang podcast, the singer says she has no plans for another tour in the foreseeable future.


	“The last 10 or 15 years will look very different to the ones that are coming up,” she said. “I don't want to say anything definitive. I do know that I'm very excited to do this small tour, but I think it might not happen again for a long, long, long, long, long time. I'm going to give it my all and it's going to be beautiful. I think that's why I'm doing it because I'm like, ‘One last hurrah!'”

	The man accused of shooting and killing King of the Hill actor Jonathan Joss in June has been indicted for murder. 


	On Monday, a grand jury indicted Sigfredo Ceja Alvarez, 57, on one count of murder, according to Bexar County court records (via People). Alvarez was arrested in June on a charge of first-degree murder. He was subsequently released on a $200,000 bond. 


	Joss was shot and killed after a dispute near his San Antonio, Texas home on June 1. Following Joss' death, the actor's husband, Tristan Kern de Gonzales, said on social media that the couple was approached by the neighbor who began yelling homophobic slurs and fired his gun. “Jonathan and I had no weapons. We were not threatening anyone,” Kern de Gonzales wrote. “We were standing side by side. When the man fired, Jonathan pushed me out of the way. He saved my life.” 


	After the shooting, Alvarez fled the scene in a vehicle, but later confessed to killing Joss  when he was detained by police. According to the police report, Ceja Alvarez told the first officers to arrive, “I shot him.”

	In his post, Kern de Gonzales noted that the couple's sexuality was often an issue with locals. “We were harassed regularly by individuals who made it clear they did not accept our relationship,” he wrote. “Much of the harassment was openly homophobic.” At the time of Joss' death, they were living in hotels after a fire burned down Joss' longtime home. 


	In a statement to Rolling Stone earlier this year, the San Antonio Police Department's Public Information Office defended its response to the many threats against the couple. “SAPD officers responded to more than 70 calls for service at Joss' address,” a spokesperson wrote in an email. “Additionally, the [San Antonio Fear Free Environment] officer assigned to the neighborhood maintained regular contact with both Joss and his neighbors for over a year. The SAPD Mental Health Unit was also engaged and provided additional resources and support.”

	Ceja Alvarez initially claimed self defense and denied allegations of homophobia, and one of his relatives told the San Antonio Express-News that no one in the family had made homophobic comments to Joss. His lawyer told KSAT on June 24 that the shooting had “nothing to do with sexual orientation” and that “people in Texas have a right not to be a victim.”

	Joss, whose legal name was Jonathan Joss Gonzales, was known for his voice acting in all 13 seasons of King of the Hill, which ended in 2010. He also appeared in five episodes of the NBC hit Parks and Recreation as Chief Ken Hotate, a Native American tribal elder, as well as in films like True Grit and The Magnificent Seven.  


	Following news of his death, King of the Hill's co-creators, Mike Judge and Greg Daniels, and revival showrunner Saladin Patterson shared a post on Instagram alongside images of Joss and his character, John Redcorn. “Jonathan brought King of the Hill's ‘John Redcorn' to life for over a dozen seasons, including in the upcoming revival,” they wrote. “His voice will be missed at King of the Hill, and we extend our deepest condolences to Jonathan's friends and family.”

In another shock elimination, five couples now move onto the Nov. 25 season 34 finale, where a new winner of the show will be named. 


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



[This story contains spoilers from episode 10 of Dancing With the Stars season 34.]


	Season 34 of Dancing With the Stars is nearly over, but before it comes to a close, the couples are honoring the late Prince.




	Tuesday night marked the semi-finals, where couples performed two competitive dances: one in a ballroom style they have already learned on the show and a second number in a dance style they have not yet performed. Each number will be set to a song by Prince.

	Whitney Leavitt and Mark Ballas were eliminated at the end of Prince Night. It was an emotional elimination in the ballroom and quite a shocking one, as Whitney and Mark have consistently performed (and scored) well throughout the duration of season 34.  

	











	Heading into Tuesday's episode, social media star Alix Earle, Olympic gymnast Jordan Chiles, The Traitors season three winner (and Zac Efron's brother) Dylan Efron, actress Elaine Hendrix, conservationist (and son of Steve Irwin) Robert Irwin and Secret Lives of Mormon Wives star Whitney rounded out the remaining cast, while Whitney exited the show at the end of the episode.


	The winner of DWTS will be crowned during the special three-hour finale on Nov. 25, which will task the couples to perform in three rounds of competition, including the judges choice, instant dance and coveted freestyle rounds. The semi-finals episode determined which couples moved forward with a shot at the mirrorball, as a crowded five duos head into the final episode of season 34. (Read The Hollywood Reporter‘s ranking of the top 10 dances of season 34, so far, here.)

	











	Notably in the crowd for the semi-finals was Dylan's brother Zac, marking the first time The Iron Claw star attended a live taping in support of his brother.  Robert and Witney topped the leaderboard after the first round of competition, becoming the only duo to earn a perfect 30/30 in the first half of Prince Night.


	The second round saw three couples given perfect marks, including Alix, Elaine and Jordan, with the latter two celebrities acquiring their first flawless scores ever. After both numbers were performed by each couple, Robert and Witney remained as the top-scoring pair of the night, with a combined 59 points. 


	During last week's 20th Birthday Party-themed episode, Tom Bergeron made his guest judge debut while four couples earned solo perfect scores, including Robert and Witney Carson; Dylan and Daniella Karagach; Alix and Val Chmerkovskiy; and Whitney and Mark Ballas.


	After the show, Jordan and Ezra spoke with The Hollywood Reporter, where the gymnast said receiving her first perfect DWTS score felt “different” and that she was “honored.”


	“Yes, I've gotten 10s in my career, but getting a perfect score is different. I feel just a different light — I don't even know how to explain [it],” Chiles said. “When I got that score, I was just like, Wow. It's like a next step, the next chapter that I'm gonna be able to create, so I'm just honored.” 


	Elaine, who was called safe first out of all the couples on Prince Night, told THR she felt “so much shock, gratitude [and] excitement beyond belief” when it was announced she was moving onto the finale. She also reflected on her journey thus far, noting that she “knew [DWTS] was gonna be hard, but I did not know it was going to be just how hard it is.” 

	











	“So to actually be here now [going into the finale,] just blows my mind that it's actually a reality,” Elaine added. “I'm stunned. I'm grateful. I'm relieved. It's just a whirlwind of emotions.” 


	Alix and Val also caught up with THR, where the pro dancer sung praise towards the social media star: “I've had a whole spectrum of emotions throughout my tenure on the show, and there have been times when I was pleasantly surprised, I will tell you, there's been plenty of times when I was unpleasantly surprised. And that's why I don't take anything for granted. And of course I was confident, I have a superstar as my partner.” 


	The couple with the lowest combined total of judges' scores and viewer votes is eliminated at the end of each episode. Live voting takes place during the East Coast airing of each show and ends shortly after the final performance is completed.

Peter Balkan sounds like he should be a minor celebrity, a major figure in Mountain Goats' lore, or both. In fact, he's a recent figment of John Darnielle's imagination, a name that appeared to him in a dream along with the title of his band's 23rd album, which coalesces around a narrative about an imperiled sea voyage that leaves three survivors stranded on a beach. This self-contained tale about endings, deprivation, and subsistence without hope gestures toward rising sea levels and humanity's helplessness as the 21st Century unravels. During these ominous times, Darnielle's most intimate record in years feels like his most universal.

It also happens to be the Mountain Goats' most gleefully arranged outing since Darnielle began the project as a solo artist in 1991. Pedal steel, woodwinds, and strings abound, thanks in part to the maximalist bent of multi-instrumentalist Matt Douglas, who plays foil to Darnielle's literary strain. This juxtaposition of instrumentation and lyrics is hardly ironic: The trio of seamen at Through This Fire's center are delirious from running on fumes as well as starvation and injury, and their song cycle—billed as Darnielle's too-macabre-for-Broadway “musical”—reaches for uplift. Lin-Manuel Miranda shows up to sing backing vocals on several tracks, which isn't such a stretch on an album with an orchestral opener called “Overture” followed by a number, “Fishing Boat” that sets the scene and the showtune tone: “Free as the wind on the ocean/Wild as the rain in the storm.” Miranda's contributions are so trifling that even Hamilton diehards might mistake him for just another Mountain Goat. He doesn't need to be there: Darnielle's three-act knack was already evident without a feeble cosign from a megastar responsible for a revisionist history as troubling as it is famous.

The thespian framing results in an unusually linear Mountain Goats record full of powerful moments that not even the eternally moving Darnielle can scrape into the whole it deserves. Devastating, doomed couplets abound: “Nobody thought to carry a compass/It's not the 19th century anymore,” he quips; and later, “You were already talking when I woke up today/For a man on combat rations, you sure do find a lot to say.” Flute, clarinet, and French horn bring a disarming warmth, while percussionist Jon Wurster plays on many of the cuts as if caught in an endless drum fill, his heavy use of toms evoking another theatrical opus, Lou Reed's cracked 1973 masterpiece Berlin.

When one of the remaining members of the crew—Adam, his name a wicked twist on biblical allusion—walks into the sea and drowns himself on “Rocks in my Pocket,” the pathos is wrenching: “Some people name their cars or their guitars,” he comments on the eponymous stones, “Some things are too fragile to name.” Ditto when the album's unnamed, 16-year-old protagonist asks Peter Balkan, “Will you lie still while I reapply your bandage?” Darnielle shows the thinness of the line between rite of passage and funeral rite. We're made to think of how global warming-related disasters instantaneously transform hum-drum lives into mortal battles with nature. “It's time for you to go/But you never lost your glow,” Darnielle laments in the stirring “Your Glow,” which he expands to encompass the whole globe: “If there's nothing left but water/Then let water be enough.” The human spirit preserves, just as the world will keep turning in the absence of people.

This conceit is weighty, sometimes profound, and also pat for a songwriter who has created towering dramas with more quotidian stakes —the aging of the counterculture, which he depicted with exceptional poignance on 2015's Goths, or the horror of living with an abusive stepfather, a theme that courses through 2005's classic The Sunset Tree. These works are sinuous, robust and thick with implication, while Through This Fire proceeds with event after event, and even as Darnielle's words cut to the quick, we feel as if his songcraft glides across the surface. Take closer “Broken to Begin With,” with its swelling guitar solo that echoes his friends in the Hold Steady. Presumably in the waning minutes of his existence on earth, the adolescent speaker pictures his campsite discovered in years to come by “Men of old who sailed the seas.” The notion of a civilization destroying itself to rise again in a pre-industrial mode is crushingly resonant, but its exploration of the mysteries of existence feels too predetermined. An abrupt restatement of the chorus of “Cold At Night” finishes the LP and only contributes to its overall air of slightness. Through This Fire seems confused about whether it wants to reach for miniaturist genius or ambitious sweep—the Mountain Goats managed to achieve both in the past.

On occasion, Darnielle allows us to reach for our own connections, rather than setting them in our hands, wrapped in wisdom and a perfect sense of meter. “Everything that sinks will float,” he repeats in his relentless sing-song on “The Lady From Shanghai 2.” This statement envisions a poetic fate for the corpses of lost sailors, but it also resuscitates a memorable tidbit for fans: on the band's last record, 2023's Jenny From Thebes, the titular character, a woman devoted to protecting the threatened outcasts of West Texas, murders a ne'er-do-well landlord, stores his body in a water tower, and then sets him free, to “float downstream.” Death may be inevitable, but Darnielle casts out lifelines in his work, rescuing old motifs in order to refuse simple interpretations, tidy conclusions, and despair. And so his practice feels bottomless, while Through This Fire pushes ever forward as if its author had a destination in mind when he began the journey of writing. Such unswerving momentum is a mistake for which his immense skill can only partially compensate. The ocean, after all, is not just wide, it's deep.

	This year, the Children's and Family Emmys also adjusted a number of categories. Best single role voice performance and multiple role voice performance in preschool programs were merged into one category of outstanding voice performer in a preschool program. Best directing for single- and multiple-camera live-action programs were merged into one best directing for a live-action series category. The best editing categories were previously split by single-camera and multi-camera program but are now split by age into best editing for a preschool or children's live-action program and best editing for a young teen live-action program. And the outstanding lighting, camera and technical arts categories and outstanding cinematography categories were merged into one category each for live-action and multiple-camera shows.

	











	“We're excited to honor the extraordinary individuals and teams who bring children's and family television to life every day,” said Rachel Schwartz, head of the Children's & Family Emmy Awards. “As the landscape continues to grow — and as studies highlight the positive impact educational programming has on young children — we look forward to coming together to celebrate this meaningful and inspiring work.”

ROSALÍA makes history with an unprecedented feat, as she becomes the first artist to secure five No. 1 debuts across Billboard charts (dated Nov. 22). LUX, her fourth studio album, opens at No. 1 on Top Latin Albums, Top Latin Pop Albums, Classical Albums, Classical Crossover, and World Albums. The set also debuts at No. 4 on Billboard 200 chart, making her first top 10 on the overall chart.

LUX opens with 46,000 equivalent album units earned in the United States on the tracking week ending Nov. 13, according to Luminate. While ROSALÍA scored two No. 1 albums on the Top Latin Pop Albums chart previously through El Mal Querer (2018) and Motomami (24 weeks at No. 1 between 2022-23), LUX marks the Spaniard's first effort to reach No. 1 on Top Latin Albums and her first top 10 on the all-genre Billboard 200. It's also her first title to reach Classical Albums, Classical Crossover and World Albums.

	











	Out of LUX's 46,000 total units in its opening week, streaming activity contributed 27,000 units, translating to 34.1 million on-demand official U.S. streams. Meanwhile, album sales accounted for 19,000, with minimal contribution from track-equivalent album (TEA) units.




Top Latin Albums' Best: ROSALÍA achieves her strongest performance yet on the Top Latin Albums chart as LUX debuts at No. 1. This marks her best showing on the overall Latin albums ranking among three entries. Her 2018 album El Mal Querer peaked at No. 10, while Motomami climbed to No. 3 in 2022.


First Spanish-Born Woman to Top Classical Albums & Classical Crossover Albums Charts in Modern Era: While the Classical Albums and Classical Crossover Albums charts have featured numerous core Latin and Spanish-born artists over the years, until now, a Spanish-born woman had never claimed the top spot on either chart in the modern era (since Luminate's electronically-tracked data began powering both charts in December 1993). Renowned Spain-born figures José Carreras and Plácido Domingo, and Venezuelan Gustavo Dudamel have all achieved No. 1s on the Classical Albums chart, with Carreras and Domingo also earning a No. 1 on the Crossover Albums chart in 1997.


	With the arrival of LUX, ROSALÍA breaks new ground, becoming the first woman who is both Spanish-born and primarily a Latin recording artist, to achieve a No. 1 on both charts in the modern era.


First Spanish-Speaking Solo Woman to Reach No. 1 on the World Albums Chart: Nine acts who speak and predominantly perform in Spanish have previously reached No. 1 on the World Albums chart. Among those, Cuban ensemble Buena Vista Social Club (1999, 2015), Spanish artist Manu Chao (2007), Mexican duo Rodrigo y Gabriela (2007, 2009, 2014), Puerto Rican artist Residente (2017), Mexican musician Santana (2019), Spanish group Gipsy Kings (1990, 1994-1997, 2001, 2004, 2013), Colombian Pedro Ramaya Beltrán (2017), and Peruvian artists Ricardo Delgado and Mario Mendoza (both in 2017).With her album LUX, Rosalía becomes the first-ever Spanish-speaking solo woman to claim the top spot on the 25-position World Albums ranking.

	











Most Simultaneous Songs for a Latin Pop Act on Hot Latin Songs in Over a Year: ROSALÍA sets a new standard for Latin pop acts by placing 11 simultaneous songs on the Hot Latin Songs chart in 2025, which incorporates streaming data, radio airplay, and digital sales to rank songs. Prior, only one Latin pop artist had reached similar milestones in a single week: Kali Uchis, with 14 concurrent tracks in January 2024.


	Starting at No. 3, “La Perla,” with Yahritza y Su Esencia, leads the new tracks with 4.8 million official on-demand streams. Plus, “Reliquia” the album's second top 10 hit, debuts at No. 10 with 3.2 million official on-demand clicks during its opening week. With these two new top 10 entries, ROSALÍA captures her ninth top 10 on Hot Latin Songs.


	Here's a rundown of ROSALÍA's LUX tracks on the Hot Latin Songs chart (dated Nov. 22):


	No. 3, “La Perla,” Yahritza y Su EsenciaNo. 10, “Reliquia”No. 13, “Sexo, Violencia y Llantas”No. 15, “Porcelana”No. 17, “Dios Es Un Stalker”No. 23, “La Yugular”No. 25, “De Madrugá”No. 26, “Mundo Nuevo”No. 28, ‘Sauvignon Blanc”No. 30, “La Rumba Del Perdón,” with Estrella Morente & Silvia Pérez-CruzNo. 36, “Magnolias”

When casting director Jessica Ronane came on board to cast her second feature film, “After the Hunt,” for filmmaker Luca Guadagnino (the pair had previously collaborated on “Queer” and will next partner on his OpenAI film “Artificial”), she had the benefit of some major star power already in place: Julia Roberts was signed on to play the film's central character, the inscrutable Yale professor Alma, caught in the midst of an abuse scandal that threatens every part of her life.

For a casting director, having such wattage attached from the outset could have proven complicated to the rest of the casting process, but Ronane found it actually freed her up to have some more fun (unless, of course, Guadagnino got there first). During IndieWire's recent Crafts Roundtable discussion, presented in partnership with Amazon MGM Studios, Ronane shared a bit about her process assembling a relatively small cast around such a huge star.

“With Julia already attached, you know, it's quite a small cast actually, so there were a few roles that we could be playful in our thinking, for just a moment before the whole thing would grow and they would need actors [in place],” Ronane said. “We started talking about the role of Maggie, and I had a chance to sort of demonstrate the landscape, what that could be.” 

 










The role eventually went to Ayo Edebiri, who is remarkable in the tricky role, one that requires her to repeatedly face off with a formidable Roberts.

Ronane also noted that the ever-busy and always-working Guadagnino is also constantly seeking out possible performers for their collaborations, which makes her eager to show her work to the filmmaker. “Luca is also always meeting actors in different ways across his body of work and within his world,” she said. “So I always know there is a slight race against time before somebody he's getting into wins the role and I've not actually managed to do my job, so I kind of have to really push at that time, with each of those roles, to analyze everyone, and also trusting the instinct of the director as well, because sometimes they have a very strong feeling and you need to support that.”

Home » US » Two US Men Testing Phone Camera Accidentally Film UFO in Wisconsin

Have you ever imagined accidentally filming a UFO while simply testing your camera? This month, two men in the United States experienced exactly that.

The incident happened on Nov. 4 this year in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. The people filming were 33-year-old Alex Ramage and 38-year-old Andrei Volk. During a break at work, they planned to film airplanes in the sky to test the zoom function on a Samsung phone. After recording the video and watching the playback together, they were stunned to see an oval-shaped mysterious object appear in the sky.

After watching the bizarre footage, both Alex and Andrei were shocked. Alex believes they captured evidence of extraterrestrial life. Both insist the video was not fabricated, and they cannot explain the unidentified flying object in it. Alex said: “We thought it was crazy. We were terrified!” They were only filming airplanes, and never expected to see a disk-shaped object in the playback. From Alex's perspective, the UFO had a dome in the center of the disc — exactly like the typical UFO image people imagine.

Alex said the object moved differently from an airplane. It seemed to be gliding, and he believes it looked nothing like a plane. The discovery left both of them thrilled and astonished. Alex has always believed UFOs exist, but never imagined he would witness one with his own eyes. “We were shocked! We couldn't even talk — we were just casually filming. What are the odds?”

Reports say another UFO sighting occurred on the 13th of this month. A black ring appeared in the sky above Disneyland in California, causing panic among visitors who feared there might be extraterrestrial life nearby. Many were stunned by the phenomenon.

Footage of the sighting spread rapidly online. Lori Nayahalski, who shared the video, said she was most impressed that the “ring” remained perfectly intact as it moved across the sky. She told the media: “Is this the real-life Matrix? Or an elaborate prank?”

A Disney spokesperson later said the mysterious ring was caused by a fireworks test.

Fresh from finding potential biosignatures on the Bright Angel formation in Cheyava Falls, announced in September, NASA's Perseverance rover has discovered a highly unusual and out of place rock on Mars.

Every now and then, the rovers exploring the Red Planet send back an image of an unusual rock on our neighbor planet. These can range from the interesting, for example, this coral-shaped rock, to the interesting to conspiracy theorists, such as this "crab shark" formation. The latest discovery, found while studying bedrocks in the Vernodden area along the Jezero crater's rim, firmly fits into the former category. 

The 80-centimeter (31-inch) wide rock, named “Phippsaksla", stands out from its environment. It was found back on September 2, 2025, using Perseverance's Left Mastcam-Z camera, on Sol 1612, the 1,612th day of the rover's mission. According to analysis from NASA, the rock likely did not originate on Mars. 

"This rock was identified as a target of interest based on its sculpted, high-standing appearance that differed from that of the low-lying, flat and fragmented surrounding rocks," Candice Bedford, Research Scientist at Purdue University, explained in a NASA blog post. 

"Last week, Perseverance targeted Phippsaksla with the SuperCam instrument revealing that it is high in iron and nickel. This element combination is usually associated with iron-nickel meteorites formed in the core of large asteroids, suggesting that this rock formed elsewhere in the solar system."

The team will have to investigate the rock further to determine if it is a meteorite. If it is, it would be the first found by the Perseverance rover, which in itself is a little surprising. The other Mars rovers, including both Mars Exploration Rovers, Opportunity and Spirit, and Curiosity, have all found their own iron and nickel-rich meteorites during their time exploring the Red Planet.

"As such, it has been somewhat unexpected that Perseverance had not seen iron-nickel meteorites within Jezero crater, particularly given its similar age to Gale crater and number of smaller impact craters suggesting that meteorites did fall on the crater floor, delta, and crater rim throughout time," Bedford added. 

It's not unexpected that the rovers should find plenty of meteorites on the planet, given its thin atmosphere and position within the Solar System. Estimates, looking at NASA's InSight seismometer data, suggest that the planet gets hit by around 280 to 360 meteorite impacts every year, which are large enough to produce craters larger than 8 meters (26 feet) wide. In fact, it's a little intriguing why we haven't spotted more of them, given the robots and orbiters we have exploring the planet.

"Researchers have puzzled over why they haven't detected more meteoroid impacts on Mars," NASA explains in a separate blog post. "The Red Planet is next to the solar system's main asteroid belt, which provides an ample supply of space rocks to scar the planet's surface. Because Mars' atmosphere is just 1% as thick as Earth's, more meteoroids pass through it without disintegrating."

Nevertheless, Perseverance appears to have found its first meteorite on the planet, though we will have to wait for confirmation.

Charlie Kirk's former head of security, Brian Harpole, is pushing back against online conspiracy theories surrounding the Utah shooting that killed the conservative commentator. Speaking with podcaster Shawn Ryan, Harpole addressed the viral claims that his “unusual hand movements” before the attack were coded signals — a theory that has exploded across social media. Harpole clarified how real security teams operate and emphasised that no professional detail would ever rely on ambiguous hand gestures, especially ones easily confused with normal movement.

In a revelation that has sent ripples through the astronomical community, an international team of scientists claims to have uncovered the first tangible evidence of advanced extraterrestrial civilizations. Through Project Hephaistos, researchers from Sweden, India, the US, and the UK have identified potential Dyson spheres—massive hypothetical structures built by intelligent beings to harness a star's energy. This discovery, detailed in a study published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, marks a pivotal moment in the search for technosignatures beyond Earth.

The project analyzed data from the European Space Agency's Gaia satellite, NASA's WISE telescope, and the 2MASS survey, scanning millions of stars for infrared excesses that could indicate artificial megastructures. Out of over five million sources, the team pinpointed seven candidates exhibiting unusual infrared emissions unexplained by natural phenomena. ‘These are not definitive proofs, but they are compelling anomalies that warrant further investigation,' said Erik Zackrisson, lead researcher from Uppsala University, as reported by indy100.

Unraveling the Dyson Sphere Hypothesis

The concept of Dyson spheres, first proposed by physicist Freeman Dyson in 1960, envisions advanced civilizations constructing swarms of solar panels or habitats around their stars to capture vast amounts of energy. The Hephaistos team developed sophisticated models to detect partial Dyson spheres, focusing on infrared waste heat as a key signature. Their findings include stars with up to 60% of their light obscured in ways inconsistent with dust disks or other natural debris.

Skeptics, however, urge caution. ‘While intriguing, these signals could still stem from rare natural processes like circumstellar dust or background galaxies,' noted Beatriz Villarroel from Stockholm University in comments to Nature. The team acknowledges this, planning follow-up observations with ground-based telescopes to rule out contaminants.

From Speculation to Scientific Rigor

Building on decades of SETI efforts, Project Hephaistos represents a shift toward data-driven searches for alien technology. Unlike traditional radio signal hunts, this approach targets ‘passive' evidence of industrial activity on a cosmic scale. The candidates, all red dwarf stars within 900 light-years, show mid-infrared excesses that align with theoretical models of Dyson swarms at temperatures around 100-600 Kelvin.

Recent advancements in telescope technology have fueled such breakthroughs. The James Webb Space Telescope, for instance, has already provided strong evidence of potential biosignatures on exoplanets like K2-18b, as detailed in a 2025 report by Reuters. ‘This is the strongest evidence yet of life beyond our solar system,' said Cambridge University's Nikku Madhusudhan in the Guardian.

Industry Implications and Technological Parallels

For space industry insiders, these findings underscore the growing intersection of astrophysics and engineering. Companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin, pursuing megastructures in our own solar system, might draw inspiration—or caution—from these distant anomalies. ‘If verified, this could redefine our understanding of technological progress,' remarked Harvard's Avi Loeb in discussions about interstellar objects like 3I/ATLAS, covered by Charisma Magazine Online.

Public reaction on platforms like X has been fervent, with posts amplifying claims of imminent announcements. Users reference NASA-linked sources suggesting rival teams from Britain and China are racing to confirm technosignatures, echoing sentiments in posts from RT and Giorgio A. Tsoukalos. Yet, experts like those at Virginia Tech warn against hype, emphasizing rigorous verification.

Historical Context and Predictive Milestones

The quest for alien life has evolved from NASA's 2015 prediction by chief scientist Ellen Stofan that ‘definitive evidence' would emerge by 2025—a forecast now seemingly prescient, as per Space.com. Recent discoveries, including a super-Earth 20 light-years away detailed in ScienceDaily, enhance the habitable zone search.

Critics point to past false alarms, such as the 2016 ‘vanishing stars' hypothesis in New Scientist, which ultimately attributed phenomena to natural causes. The Hephaistos team counters this by employing AI-driven filters to minimize errors, aligning with BBC reports on AI's role in extraterrestrial searches.

Global Collaboration and Future Probes

International cooperation is key, with Indian-led expansions in intelligent life searches reported by The Hindu. Upcoming missions, including NASA's Roman Space Telescope, promise higher-resolution data to scrutinize these candidates.

Beyond Dyson spheres, 2025 has seen claims of Mars biosignatures from NASA's Perseverance rover, as hyped in CNET. ‘This could be a tipping point,' echoed astronomers in The Guardian, though Nature's coverage highlights ongoing skepticism.

Economic and Ethical Horizons

For industry leaders, confirming alien megastructures could spur investments in energy-harvesting tech, mirroring Dyson's vision. Ethical debates arise: Should humanity broadcast our presence, or remain silent amid potential risks?

As X posts from users like Michael Salla speculate on ‘November surprises,' the scientific community remains grounded. With follow-ups planned for 2026, these findings—while provisional—ignite a new era in cosmic exploration.

A recently captured NASA SkyCam video has left audiences utterly captivated. The footage shows a triangular object sporting what witnesses describe as striking 'red exhausts', igniting widespread discussion among viewers.

This extraordinary sighting is now setting the internet alight, prompting many to question what the camera captured high above Earth.

A clip shared online, labelled 'NASA SkyCam Footage', has generated widespread discussion on social media. Many who have seen the video assert it features a three-sided flying object emitting prominent 'red exhausts'.

These striking images have sparked a fresh discussion of unidentified flying objects. Still, experts in space technology say the reports do not correspond to any known NASA mechanism, suggesting they could be mistaken identity.

The alleged NASA SkyCam footage of a triangular object with 'red exhausts' is linked to several unexplained flying object (UFO) sightings and speculative narratives, rather than a verified or formally acknowledged event or phenomenon from NASA. The video in question is not posted by NASA, but it's making the rounds online.

On X, Dr Horace Drew, a scientist and inventor, posted the recording with the accompanying text, 'A large triangular UFO flew near the ISS earlier today. Everyone can see two big RED exhausts.' He asked, 'NASA SkyCam footage. What are you going to say tomorrow, guys? Planet Venus, Weather balloon, Ice crystals?'

A large triangular UFO flew near the ISS earlier today. Everyone can see two big RED exhausts. NASA SkyCam footage. What are you going to say tomorrow, guys?"Planet Venus"Weather balloon"Ice crystals" 😅😂🤣 pic.twitter.com/EynZFLflIk

Several people in the comments section requested the actual ISS recording, with one person commenting, 'When making posts like this, please post the source, it should be easy to do as you had the original'. Dr Drew agreed to the request in a second post, sharing two different recordings.

Some people asked for it, so here was the original ISS video today. You can see a large triangular UFO flying right-to-left around time 0:38 seconds (video 1). Then NASA turns off both video and audio signals at time 1:00. What a "coincidence"! An enlarged close-up of that… pic.twitter.com/a7gu1OtAgd

'You can see a large triangular UFO flying right-to-left around time 0:38 seconds (video 1)', he wrote. Then NASA turns off both video and audio signals at time 1:00. What a "coincidence"!'

'An enlarged close-up of that triangular UFO is shown in video 2. Study the alien tech carefully. Rear thrusters AND side thrusters. NASA will hold their dog-and-pony show tomorrow', he noted.

In his third message on X, Dr Drew suggested that another long International Space Station clip is being shared, which appears to show some 'space wreckage' tracking the 'real triangular UFO' as it crosses the view from right to left.

There is another long ISS video going around, which looks as if some kind of "space wreckage" follows that "real triangular UFO" through the scene from right to left. I do not wish to comment on that long video at present because: (a) it might be a fake put out by NASA, to try…

Nevertheless, he chose not to provide commentary on the previous recording, offering these justifications:

'(a) it might be a fake put out by NASA, to try and discredit the real UFO?
(b) that real UFO may really have blown something up?
(c) I find it hard to believe that NASA would be DUMB enough to restore the feed, after a huge triangular UFO passes by!'

Dr Drew expressed concern that a large number of 'sock puppets' are attempting to persuade everyone that what is visible is 'city lights on the ground', rather than the wide-ranging 'space wreckage' that seems to emerge in that location.

He maintains that some directive clearly went out to spread that deceptive explanation on X, posing the question of why, when anyone can tell it is not 'lights on the ground'.

'For me, it is enough to document a real, spectacular UFO, and not get caught up in other information that may be a deliberate fake, or else disastrously real, if we do not know which. Best wishes with love and respect to you all. The time is coming, and our world is about to change forever', he wrote.

Whether the 'red exhausts' are genuine alien propulsion or simply a trick of the camera and light remains hotly debated. While space agencies maintain the footage is a case of misidentification, the clip's viral nature ensures the conversation about unexplained phenomena high above our planet will continue to evolve, keeping viewers watching the skies — and their screens.

NASA viewers say the ISS livestream briefly switched to its routine “signal loss” slate just after a small bright object crossed the frame, igniting fresh UFO chatter. NASA has not issued a specific statement on this clip yet. NASA historically explains that these cutaways are automatic when the station drops out of relay satellite coverage or controllers switch cameras, which happens many times a day. In past flare-ups, NASA spokespeople described the ISS video system as automated and prone to blue-screening during Tracking and Data Relay Satellite handoffs.

NASA also notes that bright “objects” often prove to be meteors, reentering debris, satellites or simple reflections from the station or Earth. The pattern is familiar. The High Definition Earth Viewing experiment that made these public feeds famous ended on August 22, 2019. Today's public views come from other external cameras that behave the same way during link gaps. NASA's current UAP policy is to study unusual sightings with better data rather than speculation.

Social posts claim a distant luminous speck drifted near the Earth's limb, then the ISS stream shifted sources and displayed the familiar “no signal” slate. One Reddit eyewitness pegs it to about 11:04 a.m. US Central Time, after which the camera view changed and then showed the slate. Treat third-party timestamps cautiously unless mirrored by official logs.

How the feed works is straightforward. NASA's public ISS video rides the Tracking and Data Relay Satellites. When the ISS drops out of KU-band coverage or controllers switch sources, the public video automatically reverts to a blue screen or preset slate. That behaviour is expected and frequent. As per a CBS News report dated July 14, 2016, NASA spokesperson Daniel Huot said,

Why this fuels rumors is the timing. Sometimes the slate appears just as a bright point enters the frame, which viewers read as intent. Past NASA statements describe coincidence tied to link margins and automation, not manual censorship. Space.com's summary of the same 2016 controversy adds that both “object in view” and “feed cut” happen regularly, and that NASA “did not turn off the camera intentionally.”

Context matters for today's streams. The High Definition Earth Viewing payload stopped sending data on July 18, 2019 and was declared end of life on August 22, 2019, with later disposal on a Cygnus cargo ship. Current external cameras still provide public views and still show the same “no signal” behaviour during handoffs.

Common candidates fit known categories. Meteors or reentering debris often skim Earth's limb. Human-made satellites can briefly glint. Small flecks of ISS-adjacent debris can flash as they tumble. And optical artefacts from the station's structure, window reflections, lens flare or even bad pixels are routine. As per Space.com report dated July 14, 2016, NASA representatives stated,

Past precedent shows this pattern repeating. Media breakdowns of 2015 to 2017 clips emphasized that both “object” and “feed cut” are normal and not evidence of a deliberate blackout. The 2016 CBS coverage included NASA's technical explanation and pointed to meteors or reentering hardware as likely sources.

What is different today is the camera stack, not the behaviour. HDEV ended in 2019, yet today's external cameras still cycle and still drop to slate during TDRS handoffs. That is how the pipeline works.

On odd audio or video moments, recent confusion came from a misrouted training drill that aired by mistake. As per The Guardian report dated June 13, 2024, NASA's ISS account posted,

Of all the psychedelic drugs, such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin (the active ingredient in "magic mushrooms", with all the odd experiences they can induce in the user, one drug has a reputation amongst "psychonauts" who take them for causing particularly odd experiences.

N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), sometimes referred to as the "spirit molecule," has potentially been used for thousands of years. You may already be aware of the substance through the work of American philosopher, ethnobotanist, and author Terence McKenna, who developed some pretty strange views on the topic, or UFC commentator turned podcaster Joe Rogan.

The drug, when inhaled, produces an intense psychedelic experience which can be unsettling, profound, or destabilizing, and can last for up to 45 minutes. Even McKenna, who was no stranger to psychedelic substances, was regularly shocked by what he experienced when he took it.

"DMT is a reliable method for crossing in to a dimension that human beings have debated the existence of for 50.000 years," McKenna said of the drug. "Is there an invisible nearby world inhabited by active intelligences with which human beings can communicate? You bet. And if you don't think so, then tell me you don't think so after you've smoked 75mg DMT. Otherwise we just don't have anything to talk about."

One particularly odd aspect (we should stress this is likely due to changes taking place in the brain, though we don't know the precise mechanism yet) is a certain similarity in experiences that have been reported by DMT users. McKenna described his own experience of encountering "entities" which became known in the DMT-taking community as "machine elves".

"During my own experiences smoking synthesized DMT in Berkeley, I had had the impression of bursting into a space inhabited by merry elfin, self-transforming, machine creatures," he said in his book True Hallucinations. "Dozens of these friendly fractal entities, looking like self-dribbling Faberge eggs on the rebound, had surrounded me and tried to teach me the lost language of true poetry."

That's a pretty odd experience, and McKenna went on to describe other bizarre hallucinations, where the "elves" and "jesters" toyed with him, or else presented advanced technology to him which could be operated through song. What is really strange (though that does not mean that it is in any way supernatural) is that users tend to report fairly similar experiences.

"People who smoke DMT, and can recall their experiences in detail, frequently describe seeing vivid and detailed geometric structures, experienced synesthesia, visions of alternate worlds," one study, which looked at self-reported experiences collated from around the Internet explains, "encounters with strange autonomous entities and divine beings, interactions with complex technological objects, profound emotional and mystical experiences, and being transported to unusual and complex hyperdimensional places."

Study author Stephen Kagan attempted to break these experiences down into categories of Places, Objects, Entities, Feelings, and Attributes, which were further broken down (for instance, the Places category contains experiences of domes, caves, space, and hyperdimensional places).

"In the majority of reports, people who encountered complex visual and synaesthetic phenomena and had the experience of entering alternate realities did not describe their experiences as being manifestations of their own minds and frequently described what they encountered as being autonomous of themselves and independent of their influence," the study reads.

"Some people also described the content of their experiences as being more real than real. This often meant that what they experienced was more vibrant, complex, varied or detailed than what they normally experienced in their daily lives. In most cases the ability to perceive their normal surrounding reality did not remain intact and if it did, then the content and structure of their DMT experiences were superimposed upon and within the external world."

  

Some of the more interesting "entities" seen by DMT users included "gods:mythic", "jester:clown", "elves:goblins" and a rather sinister category of "disembodied". Humanoids were the most-encountered of the reported entities at 36 percent, with more unusual "living machines" appearing in 16 percent of experiences, narrowly beating snakes and dragons on 15 percent. As reassuring as "humanoid" sounds, the experiences were far from usual than regular humanoid humans.

"Sometimes they appear as aliens, family members, have strange shaped bodies or heads, limbs with extra joints or that separate in unusual ways," the study reads. "Their clothing varied from spacesuits to tribal to that of ancient Egyptians or Greeks and their skin varied in color, sometimes blue, red or golden. Their language was usually telepathic or easily understood."

In many of the experiences, the hallucinated entities acted as guides, imparting wisdom whether they were an insectoid or a simple geometric shape. Another small study found that 94 percent of the participants experienced "encounters" with other beings, with over half describing these "encounters" as benevolent. One archetype, described by a user in this study, was one referred to as the "trickster" by DMT users.

"A female face which was tempting me, which I'm kind of familiar with… Then, everything slipped, everything stripped away. As I was tempted in, lured in… and there was like a ‘Hehehe', there was a mischievousness to it. She was definitely giggling, as if to say, ‘This fucking stupid idiot here he comes again I'm gonna show him, Bang!'… She's beckoning with a sort of finger like this, going ‘come in, come in', and I thought OK, I'm mesmerised, so I follow her in," one user described.

"This female entity is fucking all-powerful but at the same time very mischievous and jokey and infantile… So she's like, ‘I'm the master and orchestrator of this whole situation, but I like having a laugh at the same time'… In that space it's almost like she came to get me, kind of knew I was coming – ‘Come, come, come, giggle giggle, laugh, look at that, now you are here, now I just sit back and watch you!'"

Though these experiences are certainly taking place in the brain (we're a science website, please don't get mad at us for saying that), they can certainly have a profound effect on the user.

"More than half of those who identified as atheist before the experience no longer identified as atheist afterwards," another study explains. "The experiences were rated as among the most meaningful, spiritual, and psychologically insightful lifetime experiences, with persisting positive changes in life satisfaction, purpose, and meaning attributed to the experiences."

They note that "entity encounter experiences have many similarities to non-drug entity encounter experiences such as those described in religious, alien abduction, and near-death contexts."

So what is going on in the brain during these experiences?

  

"One explanation is that DMT stimulates regions of the brain which give rise to both the visual aspect of a being and also the experience of sensed presence," Dr David Luke, associate professor of psychology at Greenwich University and author of the book DMT Entity Encounters, told IFLScience. "However, in my research I've come across people who have aphantasia, which means they have no visual mental imagery. When they have DMT experiences they don't see anything, and yet they have entity encounters, so the visual aspect isn't even necessary for having these encounter experiences."

One idea, backed by a study that used electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) on people undergoing a DMT dose, is that DMT blurs the boundaries of brain networks, resulting in "global functional connectivity".

"One increasingly popular view is that much of brain function is concerned with modelling or predicting its environment. Humans have unusually big brains and model an unusually large amount of the world," first author Dr Chris Timmermann, from the Centre for Psychedelic Research at Imperial College London, said in a statement at the time. 

"For example, like with optical illusions, when we're looking at something, some of what we're actually seeing is our brain filling in the blanks based on what we already know. What we have seen with DMT is that activity in highly evolved areas and systems of the brain that encode especially high-level models becomes highly dysregulated under the drug, and this relates to the intense drug ‘trip'."

Though we would like to give something more conclusive for why users report these experiences, the truth is that we have a better picture from studies like these, but more research is needed.

"Our results revealed that when a volunteer was on DMT there was a marked dysregulation of some of the brain rhythms that would ordinarily be dominant. The brain switched in its mode of functioning to something altogether more anarchic," senior author Professor Robin Carhart-Harris, founder of the Centre for Psychedelic Research at Imperial College London, added.

"It will be fascinating to follow-up on these insights in the years to come. Psychedelics are proving to be extremely powerful scientific tools for furthering our understanding of how brain activity relates to conscious experience."

‘Supernatural' ran for 15 seasons — and introduced more than one cast member to their partner

Gary Miller/Getty; Kevin Mazur/Getty

 Supernatural may be a show about hunting demons and facing the paranormal, but for many stars, it also sparked real-life love stories.


 The fan-favorite CW drama, which ran for 15 seasons from 2005 to 2020, followed brothers Sam and Dean Winchester — played by Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles, respectively — as they traveled the country hunting demons, ghosts and other paranormal creatures while uncovering dark family secrets.


 But while the Winchesters were saving the world on-screen, several cast members were finding lasting connections off-screen.


 Jared met his future wife, Genevieve Padalecki, on set while she was filming a scene as the demon Ruby, and the Winchesters' on-screen dad, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, met his wife, Hilarie Burton, thanks to a castmate's introduction.


 When the series finale aired on Nov. 19, 2020, it marked an emotional farewell between the actors and their beloved characters — but also a moment of gratitude for what the show had brought into their lives.


 Genevieve honored that chapter with a heartfelt Instagram tribute to her husband and their shared journey:


 "Jared, what you have given to Sam Winchester, to the cast, the crew, the friends you've met, the family you've grown is immeasurable. You walked in a young kid of 23 and walked away married to a demon and spawned 3 children," she wrote.


 From on-set meet-cutes to behind-the-scenes romances, here's a look at the real-life love stories that began in the world of Supernatural.


Jared Padalecki/instagram

 Jared met his future wife, Genevieve, on the set of Supernatural, when she appeared as the demon Ruby.


 "I was a single dude, and she was a pretty girl in her underwear on her first day on set," Jared told fans at a 2012 Supernatural panel. "I was very excited to meet her ... I interrupted her while she was reading a book and I think she got kind of fussy about it."


 Jared proposed in 2009 in front of Genevieve's favorite painting, Joan of Arc by Jules Bastien-Lepage, at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, according to Sun Valley Magazine. They tied the knot the following year in her hometown of Sun Valley, Idaho.


 In 2010, Jared and Genevieve moved to Austin, Texas, where they raise their three kids — and a flock of chickens. They welcomed their first son, Thomas "Tom" Colton, on March 19, 2012, and their second son, Austin "Shep" Shepherd, was born at home on Dec. 22, 2013. Jared and Genevieve had their daughter, Odette Elliott, on March 17, 2017.


 The couple said goodbye to the show that brought them together in 2020. “Because of this show, we're now celebrating almost 11 years married, 3 amazing kids, traveling the world together, and making incredible friends who have formed and shaped who we are today,” Genevieve wrote on X following the Supernatural finale.


 In 2021, Jared and Genevieve reunited on-screen in Walker, playing husband and wife once again.


 "Being able to show her off to the cast and crew was awesome," Jared told PEOPLE. "She sacrificed so much while I was in Vancouver [shooting Supernatural] ... She was home a lot with the kids, changing diapers and making lunches. So getting her back out with people with similar passions and interests was awesome to see. It's good to flex those muscles again!"

 Jensen has been married to One Tree Hill actress Danneel Ackles since 2010.


 The two shared the screen together before they began dating in the 2007 film Ten Inch Hero. However, unlike costars Jared and Genevieve, the two were married before Danneel appeared on Supernatural in 2018.


 The couple wed in Dallas in 2010, and Danneel shared a series of pictures from the event on their eighth wedding anniversary on Facebook, calling her husband “the most patient man on earth.”


 The couple now share three children; they announced the birth of their first child, Justice Jay, on May 30, 2013, and three years later, Jensen and Danneel welcomed fraternal twins Zeppelin Bram and Arrow Rhodes.


 They have since taken on several projects together, launching Chaos Machine Productions in 2020 with their first project as co-executive producers being a Supernatural spinoff called The Winchesters.


 Jensen and Danneel also co-own the Family Business Beer Co., a brewery with a nod back to Supernatural's famous opener.


Misha Collins/instagram

 The actor behind the angel Castiel, Misha Collins, was married to author Victoria Vantoch for over two decades. The couple went on to welcome two children: son West and daughter Maison.


 Collins confirmed that he and Vantoch had separated in the acknowledgments of his 2021 poetry collection, Some Things I Still Can't Tell You.


 He seemingly debuted a new relationship in August 2024, when he posted a picture on Instagram with Emily Farallon at the Democratic National Convention.


 “Emily's so excited to be here, she finally let me post a photo,” Collins wrote.


 The two have since shared photos together on hikes and goofing around in the kitchen. In November 2025, Collins and Farallon posted essays on Substack about their values and relationship.


Mark Sheppard/instagram

 Mark Sheppard, who played the demon Crowley for seven seasons of Supernatural, met his wife, Sarah Louise Sheppard, thanks to the show.


 The couple first crossed paths at a 2014 Supernatural convention in Vancouver — what was meant to be Sarah's last, according to her Instagram.


 "That was going to be my last convention but I was having a drink with some friends… & a certain Mark Sheppard was waved over to join us. It was like time stopped when we started talking," she recalled.


 A longtime fan of the show, Sarah acknowledged the conversations around Mark dating a fan — “as well there should have been,” she noted on Instagram — but added that she and Mark were “the real deal.”


 The two welcomed a daughter, Isabella Rose Sheppard, on March 1, 2016, and also parent Mark's two sons from a previous marriage.


 In 2023, Mark credited Sarah with saving his life after he suffered six heart attacks.


 "If not for my wife, the @losangelesfiredepartment at Mulholland and the incredible staff @providencecalifornia St. Joseph's - I wouldn't be writing this," he wrote on Instagram.


Jamie McCarthy/Getty 

 For Morgan, who played the demon-hunting father of Sam and Dean, love also found its way into his life through Supernatural.


 It was fellow cast member Jensen and his wife, Danneel, who introduced Morgan to One Tree Hill actress Hilarie Burton on a blind date in 2009. The pair hit it off instantly and have been together ever since, welcoming their son, Augustus, the following year. Their daughter, George Virginia, was born in 2018, and in 2019, Morgan and Burton decided to officially tie the knot.


 Burton told PEOPLE that their decision to get married was about being honest with each other and the relationship they had.


 "We had built this life together. We'd had kids together. I think there comes a point where you just don't want to go another day by being inauthentic about it," she said.


 In 2021, the couple brought their love story to the screen, appearing together on The Walking Dead. Burton played Lucille, the late wife of Morgan's character, Negan, whose infamous barbed wire-wrapped bat is named after her. Their son, Augustus, even made his acting debut in the same episode, appearing as a young zombie.


 On Instagram, Morgan called working with his wife “the highlight of [his] career."


Mark Pellegrino/instagram

 Mark Pellegrino, best known to Supernatural fans as Lucifer, is married to director and acting coach Tracy Pellegrino.


 She is known for her work on Strangers in a Strange Land (2018), according to her IMDb, but she's also played a behind-the-scenes role in many of Mark's biggest projects — including Dexter, Lost and Supernatural.


 In a video shared on Tracy's Instagram, Mark revealed that she often "stealth directed" him through scenes as his on-set acting coach.


 The couple split their time between Los Angeles and Paris, according to Tracy's Instagram bio, and have posted sweet photos together in the City of Love, including a picture of the two kissing in front of the Eiffel Tower, which Mark captioned, "Lovers in paradise. Me and the lovely and amazing @tracypellegrino."


Amy Sussman/Getty

 Rob Benedict, who played Chuck Shurley (a.k.a. God), shared the screen with Ruth Connell, who played Rowena, the Queen of Hell.


 The two developed a romantic connection off-screen and announced their engagement on Oct. 29, 2024, with Benedict telling PEOPLE that he proposed earlier in the year, just before the birth of their first daughter, Margaret.


 He added, "We're getting a lot of love and support from my older children," referring to Audrey and Calvin, whom he shares with his ex-wife, Mollie. "We are very happy and looking forward to the adventure."


 Connell also shared the birth news on Instagram along with a sweet picture of the newborn's feet, writing, "In love. Much longed for. Thank you @robenedict. I love you, Calvin and Audrey — and all our friends and family, near and far."

 Actors DJ Qualls and Ty Olsson also found love through the Supernatural universe — though they never actually met on set.


 Qualls, who played the werewolf Garth on the series, announced his engagement to Olsson, who played Benny the vampire, on the May 15, 2024, episode of his Locked and Probably Loaded podcast with Kelly Blackheart. He revealed that the pair first met at a Supernatural convention, forming a close friendship that spanned over a decade before turning romantic.


 "Ty and I became inseparable at the very beginning, just immediately," Qualls shared. "Over the last 10 years, our relationship evolved to what it is today and now we're getting married."


 He also reflected on their bond. "Ty was the first person in my entire life that I ever had that kind of connection with. I say just a friend. [He is] the best friend I ever had. And now we're going to be old men together, which is so crazy,” Qualls said.


 After the episode aired, congratulations poured in from fans. Olsson then expressed his gratitude on X.


 “Thank you everyone for all the love and support and kindness today :) sending you all some love and hugs,” he said.

Tammy Bruce, the Fox News contributor turned State Department spokesperson who is now awaiting confirmation as deputy U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, spent years promoting baseless Islamophobic conspiracy theories and espousing incendiary rhetoric, including about then-President Barack Obama.

A CNN investigation examined Bruce's public comments beginning in the early 2000s and found “a pattern of demeaning language about Muslims,” including statements suggesting that American Muslims “needed to prove their loyalty” to the U.S. following 9/11.

Much of Bruce's rhetoric—the bulk of which was published on her personal blog, which is no longer available online but was accessed using the Internet Archive—targeted Obama.

Bruce referred to Obama as a “Kenyan,” an “idiot” and a ”dumb bastard,” and incorrectly described him as Muslim (Obama, a Christian, was born to an American mother and a Kenyan father in Hawaii, a U.S. state). 

She also raised questions about his birth certificate, a conspiracy theory promoted heavily at the time by Donald Trump, and suggested that Obama “secretly wishes” for the U.S. to be harmed by nuclear weapons launched by North Korea.

“Somewhere in Kenya, a village is missing its idiot,” she wrote on her blog. Bruce also criticized the U.N., describing it as America's “enemy” in one 2006 post, and advocated for it to be torn down in another.

Bruce has been working as a spokesperson for the State Department since January, and was chosen for the deputy U.N. ambassador role earlier this year. Her confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is scheduled for Wednesday.

In a post announcing her nomination to the deputy ambassador role, in which she would be serving under Ambassador Mike Waltz, Trump wrote, “Since the beginning of my Second Term, Tammy has been serving with distinction as Spokesperson of the State Department, where she did a fantastic job.”

”Tammy Bruce will represent our Country brilliantly at the United Nations. Congratulations Tammy!" 

Bruce, in turn, thanked the president in a post on X, writing, “I'm blessed that in the next few weeks my commitment to advancing America First leadership and values continues on the global stage in this new post.”

A White House spokesperson said in a statement to CNN, “Tammy Bruce was an effective Spokesperson for the State Department because of her steadfast loyalty to President Trump, which makes her an effective voice for the President and administration's views on important issues.” The Daily Beast has contacted the White House for comment.

Bruce's incendiary rhetoric was not limited to online blogs; as a Fox News personality, she garnered controversy after describing then-Harvard President Dr. Claudine Gay as “that Black woman at Harvard,” and making fun of an autistic child, calling him a “snowflake.”

Bruce also used to mock Secretary of State Marco Rubio, her boss for much of this year, dubbing him “Little Marco” and criticizing him for “sounding like his Establishment handlers.”

Her tenure as spokesperson has seen her spar with reporters as she developed a reputation for avoiding their questions, leading CNN anchors to become visibly frustrated when interviewing her live on air.

During one interview, CNN anchor Pamela Brown told the former Fox host, who had refused to answer questions about Rubio's withdrawal from Ukraine peace talks, “You are the State Department spokesperson.”

“It is very fair for me to ask you basic questions about what has been said publicly.”

”I'm trying to be!” Bruce responded, imploring Brown to “accept my answers.” ”I answered them, but not in the way that you wanted,” Bruce argued.

In this episode, Angus Fletcher explains why the human brain doesn't work like a computer and why our deepest strengths come not from logic or data processing but from imagination, emotion, and the ability to invent new futures. Drawing on neuroscience, Shakespeare, evolutionary biology, and his work with U.S. Army Special Operations, Fletcher shows how storytelling is the brain's oldest “technology,” why intelligence is rooted in action rather than analysis, and what most people get wrong about creativity and common sense.

Angus Fletcher is a professor of story science at Ohio State's Project Narrative, the world's leading academic think tank dedicated to understanding how stories work. He earned his PhD from Yale, conducted postdoctoral research at Stanford, and in 2023 received the U.S. Army's Commendation Medal for his groundbreaking work with Army Special Operations on primal intelligence. He has also written screenplays for major Hollywood studios and networks. His new book is Primal Intelligence: You Are Smarter Than You Know.
